# Managing EC2 and VPC: AWS with Python and Boto3 Series
This is the code repository for [Managing EC2 and VPC: AWS with Python and Boto3 Series](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/machine-learning-algorithmic-trading-bots-python-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789951165), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
In this course, we'll start by taking a look at the tools and the environment that we need to work with AWS resources. We will teach you how you can set up your environment on both MacOS and Windows. Once we're ready with our environment setup, we'll start implementing our solution on AWS.Then we will create two subnets; Public and Private.We will develop a startup bash script to automatically run when we launch our EC2 Instance. In this script, we will first update our packages with yum package manager so we can stay up-to-date with the latest updates and security patches. Then we will install a HTTP server on it and make sure it's working by a startup check command. After we prepare our HTTP server, we will develop a simple HTML page as a greeting and we will write this page to disk to be served when we try to access our Public EC2 Instance. And remember, we will again do all of this with our Python code!
After finishing up launching our EC2 Instances, we'll move on to learn how to describe EC2 Instances on AWS in detailed way; from their IP addresses to the subnet which they belong to. Then we'll learn how to learn how to manage EC2 Instances in various ways. We'll Stop, Start and Terminate EC2 Instances and again the best part is we will do all of that with our Python code!
