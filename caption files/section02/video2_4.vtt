00:04.030 --> 00:09.330
So I hope you have your AWOS account up and running and ready to work with.

00:09.610 --> 00:16.460
And in that case no time that we can sign into our A account to do debt.

00:16.480 --> 00:23.020
There are of course a couple of ways that we can do it and you can simply click on the sign on to cancel

00:23.020 --> 00:29.950
button right here and since I Proustian started a sign up process to show you it is still saying that

00:29.950 --> 00:31.410
I have to complete this sign up.

00:31.420 --> 00:40.350
But in your case it is probably saying sign into consol but other than that we can simply go to AWOS

00:40.440 --> 00:49.640
canso using the u r l like consol dot AWOS dot Amazon Dot com.

00:49.740 --> 00:51.570
And once I hit that

00:55.630 --> 00:58.090
I'm showing with the sign in page.

00:58.120 --> 01:05.110
And as you can see my e-mail is displayed right here and my password is auto filled by Chrome browser

01:05.230 --> 01:13.980
so I can simply hit the sign in button right now.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.860
And here we go.

01:16.180 --> 01:26.730
Our AWOS management console is presented to us right here and by default as you can see it is redirecting

01:26.730 --> 01:29.280
me to us east to region.

01:29.280 --> 01:38.980
As you can see here are with the name of that it's Ohio Leydet and to simply switch the regions from

01:39.030 --> 01:45.640
a Windows console you can simply click on this region name and you can simply select the region that

01:45.640 --> 01:53.980
you want to work with on a W-S resources and for the account information as you can see my name is being

01:53.980 --> 01:55.270
presented right here.

01:55.360 --> 02:03.370
And once I click that I can check out my account my organization my billing dashboard my credentials

02:03.400 --> 02:04.370
and so on.

02:04.510 --> 02:12.180
And I can simply sign up using the button right here and just don't worry about the wings and sections

02:12.180 --> 02:13.200
right here.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.810
I'm going to be showing you all of them.

02:15.980 --> 02:25.620
And once we go down below we have a new we have a nice little section on the top showing us the recent

02:25.620 --> 02:28.260
services that we use with AWOS.

02:28.320 --> 02:33.090
And you can simply navigate all services using this button right here.

02:33.330 --> 02:37.620
And you can simply type for some services like.

02:37.740 --> 02:43.170
Yes and you can simply go there just like that.

02:43.250 --> 02:50.620
And if you have some service that you're using frequently you can simply pin them right here.

02:50.810 --> 02:58.850
And once I click the pin button right there I can simply drag and drop services to top of my bar for

02:59.080 --> 03:00.030
a W-S.

03:00.080 --> 03:07.460
So let's suppose that I want to use the cloud watch more than most of my services and I want to have

03:07.460 --> 03:10.000
it on top of my list for free.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.320
We use services.

03:11.330 --> 03:18.950
So one side Raggatt and I can just simply drop there and I can see it it's there and I can reach it

03:18.980 --> 03:23.460
anytime I sign into a W-S console just like that.

03:23.480 --> 03:33.320
So I'll just close this now and once we go down below we have the helpful tips for AWOS seeing things

03:33.320 --> 03:42.870
like managing our coast creating an organization for a policy base and we're all based access to resources.

03:43.160 --> 03:50.960
And once we go down below a little bit further on the left side we have the solution building sections

03:51.020 --> 03:53.010
for AWOS.

03:53.120 --> 04:01.070
These things include registering a domain starting a web application development project launching virtual

04:01.070 --> 04:07.760
servers connecting to iOS devices launching virtual machines and so on.

04:07.760 --> 04:16.910
So Amazon has some real nice tutorials about launching products and services on AWOS But of course these

04:16.910 --> 04:19.640
are mostly on the manual way.

04:19.640 --> 04:25.490
Since we're not going to follow that path we're simply going to skip on that section and we're going

04:25.490 --> 04:30.220
to move one wondred our exploration of AWOS cons..

04:30.230 --> 04:30.980
All right.

04:31.220 --> 04:39.950
And on the bottom side of the page there is also a learned to build section in this section AWOS has

04:40.040 --> 04:49.500
specific videos tutorials lectures and labs on some services on AWOS and mostly all of the services.

04:49.880 --> 04:57.780
You should definitely check them out well you have the time and on the right side there is an explorer

04:57.790 --> 05:07.110
a AWOS section in that section AWOS is simply advertising some of its most popular services to a WS

05:07.110 --> 05:09.370
console users.

05:09.450 --> 05:18.620
And now let's go back up and check out our account and I'll click on my username and I'll hit my account.

05:24.480 --> 05:33.150
On my account I can see information like my account ID my account name and my contact information and

05:34.090 --> 05:44.730
down below that the payment preference my alternate contacts and my security questions and things like

05:44.730 --> 05:56.130
that and on the left pane of the window we have the sections like Bill's cost Explorer budgets reports

05:56.220 --> 06:02.770
and all the things that I need to manage my A as counsel efficiently and properly.

06:02.880 --> 06:14.920
So if I go down below the section let's say Explorer Amazon has a real nice feature for managing cost

06:14.980 --> 06:18.310
and calculating things for your usages.

06:19.100 --> 06:26.630
So coastal Explorer is just one of them and you can simply check out the details on every single usage

06:26.630 --> 06:31.000
of your AWOS services and how much they cost you.

06:31.490 --> 06:40.110
And if we go check out the other sections like payment history since this is a free Twitter account

06:40.140 --> 06:43.930
and I simply didn't have to pay anything until now.

06:44.090 --> 06:46.760
There is no payment right here.

06:46.960 --> 07:00.170
And if I go to bills again I still don't have any bills to pay to AWOS and from my account section I'll

07:00.170 --> 07:01.910
go check out my organization

07:06.050 --> 07:07.680
on the organization's actions.

07:07.700 --> 07:16.160
A.W. essay's a W-S organizations enables you to centrally apply police C-based controls across multiple

07:16.160 --> 07:18.640
accounts in the AWOS cloud.

07:18.680 --> 07:25.850
You can consolidate all your AWOS accounts into an organization and manage all A.W. accounts into distinct

07:26.090 --> 07:27.860
organizational units.

07:27.860 --> 07:37.250
So what simply says is that soon that you a very large very big company like let's say Siemens Netflix

07:37.610 --> 07:44.440
or simply any other large company that uses AWOS as the cloud solution.

07:45.290 --> 07:52.940
You have to manage your developers your admins your marketing guys and everything for their access to

07:53.000 --> 07:54.040
a WS.

07:54.080 --> 08:00.500
So you simply create your organization for your company and you're simply Dwight D.

08:00.560 --> 08:05.410
Users roles and their access to a dubious console.

08:05.430 --> 08:10.250
So this is simply that behavior for AWOS organizations.

08:10.310 --> 08:17.360
It is very useful for large and very big companies using AWOS and otherwise is just simply pointless

08:17.360 --> 08:22.880
to have as organizations enabled for a.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.860
All right.

08:23.860 --> 08:32.570
So let's go back and let's go to my billing dashboard.

08:32.990 --> 08:41.310
So again since I'm on the free tier usage of AWOS I still don't have anything to pay to Amazon

08:44.390 --> 08:51.250
and this is basically all about my account preferences for AWOS.

08:51.360 --> 08:59.020
I hope you enjoy this little walkthrough of AWOS dashboard console and the accounts sections.

08:59.900 --> 09:05.830
In the following lecture of course we're going to be digging much more into a dubius console and figuring

09:05.830 --> 09:10.850
out a way that we need to find in our issue to NVP C-sections.
