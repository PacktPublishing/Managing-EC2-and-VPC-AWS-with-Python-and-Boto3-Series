00:02.360 --> 00:09.040
We know how to access AWOS Casal by signing in from its web interface.

00:09.200 --> 00:17.840
But how about the programmatic access when we want to Manoo play things and access resources on AWOS

00:18.110 --> 00:26.330
using our popular or favorite programming language to do debt access keys and secret keys are coming

00:26.330 --> 00:28.030
into picture.

00:28.270 --> 00:37.000
So for creating an access key and secret key you first have to create a user for that and a place to

00:37.000 --> 00:46.330
do that on AWOS console is I am our identity and access management so to access identity and access

00:46.330 --> 00:56.140
management or I am less typing I am and let's jump right in and within the identity and access management

00:56.140 --> 01:03.410
page we have users groups policies roles and identity providers.

01:03.490 --> 01:09.240
I'm not going to go into the details of everything in this page and everything about the I am.

01:09.250 --> 01:16.120
But the important thing that we need to know about I am is we have to create a user for us and then

01:16.360 --> 01:23.350
we have to be generating our access keys and keys for the user.

01:23.380 --> 01:31.300
And another important thing about I am is that you see these security status on the bottom of the page.

01:31.600 --> 01:37.660
It has some checkmarks that you have to verify once you do the things that it wants you to do.

01:37.660 --> 01:45.670
So first of all Amazon is asking for do healing the root access keys for your account since it's already

01:45.670 --> 01:55.780
done within the AWOS con. It is checked as success and after that AWOS is asking me to activate the

01:56.050 --> 02:04.920
multi-factor authentication like the s m s or application base authentication for my account.

02:05.110 --> 02:12.490
You really have to do this because otherwise your account is not going to be highly secure for accessing

02:12.490 --> 02:13.680
A W-S.

02:13.690 --> 02:19.870
You might just simply lose your credentials or you're logging information and then someone else just

02:19.870 --> 02:27.640
might go into your AWOS account and start launching E.S. two instances and start doing fancy stuff in

02:27.640 --> 02:34.980
your AWOS account and you might get there where you surprised Bill about your usages on AWOS resources.

02:34.990 --> 02:42.940
So to avoid that and to be careful about your AWOS usage you really have to enable your multi-factor

02:42.940 --> 02:44.970
authentication on your account.

02:45.460 --> 02:51.980
And after that we have the individual I am users.

02:52.050 --> 02:54.050
So what do I mean by that.

02:54.300 --> 03:02.670
So you have a account that you simply use for deployment and similar things with like let's say Python

03:02.910 --> 03:05.580
a WSC a lie or anything else.

03:05.690 --> 03:07.190
Just like we're going to do.

03:07.290 --> 03:11.440
We're about to do in the lectures that we're going to follow.

03:11.820 --> 03:16.020
You have to create the user per the purpose.

03:16.140 --> 03:21.520
So you have a deployment user that you just simply use for deployment.

03:22.420 --> 03:33.130
You have a console user that you simply use only for logging into AWOS Casal Amazon and AWOS has very

03:33.130 --> 03:38.790
specific policies about accessing the console and with the programmatic access.

03:38.920 --> 03:43.160
So you can simply specify what policies you want to attach to that use.

03:43.300 --> 03:50.590
And you can do a very finely grained management on those user accounts and apart from that apart from

03:50.590 --> 03:58.670
the individual users on J-ws you can simply create groups and assign your users within those groups.

03:58.810 --> 04:05.410
And of course you can apply and I am password policy to your users in a W-S.

04:05.440 --> 04:14.170
So let's say you want to ex-party passwords for users on J-ws within like 90 days or maybe you're just

04:14.170 --> 04:19.500
simply forcing your users to use special characters in their passwords.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.220
So you want to enforce that.

04:21.220 --> 04:27.750
And this is the way to do that in A W-S within I am in this section.

04:27.890 --> 04:31.680
So let's go back to our purpose after this.

04:31.680 --> 04:38.860
Well I am lecturer and let's go into the users and let's just add a new user on.

04:39.010 --> 04:40.910
I AM ON A W-S.

04:41.110 --> 04:46.940
I'll hit on at user and I'll simply going to type in my e-mail address

04:53.830 --> 04:59.680
and once I do that all I want is a programmatic access.

04:59.980 --> 05:06.910
And as you can see as I mentioned like couple of minutes earlier you can specify where your user can

05:06.910 --> 05:13.690
access to either play programmatic level or a console based web based level.

05:13.690 --> 05:22.420
So since I care about the programmatic access I'm thinking on that and I can simply say that this user

05:22.420 --> 05:30.640
is going to be used as a deployment user and I can simply switch the name to deployment just to be specific

05:30.640 --> 05:32.130
about my purpose.

05:32.270 --> 05:34.800
And let's hit next.

05:37.340 --> 05:46.490
Since I don't have to specify a group for now because I'm simply going to use this for my API level

05:46.520 --> 05:48.030
experimentation.

05:48.200 --> 05:54.770
I'm not going to specify a group now but for accessing AWOS resources of course I have to attach some

05:54.770 --> 06:03.530
policies and I have to say that this user can access some resources on A W-S and for doing that since

06:03.530 --> 06:10.790
I don't have any existing user just like we had in the section here I have to attach existing policies

06:10.790 --> 06:12.520
directly to this user.

06:12.890 --> 06:19.010
And as you can see that we have a really nice interface in here so that we can attach policies to our

06:19.010 --> 06:22.360
user and for our purpose.

06:22.370 --> 06:29.240
I have the highest level of account on AWOS which is the administrators level access.

06:29.240 --> 06:36.170
But if you want to be specific about your purposes you can simply type easy too and you can get all

06:36.170 --> 06:42.100
the purposes about Easy to and all the policies about it for your use or for your specific users.

06:42.290 --> 06:49.060
And you can simply do you see to full access easy to read only Xs and sofort.

06:49.200 --> 06:56.250
But if you go back to our purpose again I have to give the administrative capabilities to my user so

06:56.250 --> 06:57.080
to do that.

06:57.210 --> 07:03.900
As you can see here we have the administrator access for a W-S on a programmatic level.

07:04.080 --> 07:12.080
So within the description section I can see that it provides a full access to AWOS services and resources.

07:12.090 --> 07:17.420
So this is just what I want on a W-S programmatic level access.

07:17.430 --> 07:27.960
So once I select that I can just go hit next for reviewing and I have a nice little review about my

07:28.260 --> 07:29.670
user creation.

07:29.670 --> 07:36.690
It says My user name is deployment and I want a programmatic access with an access key which I'm about

07:36.690 --> 07:43.020
to create right now and I'm going to get create user.

07:43.060 --> 07:43.980
Here we go.

07:44.260 --> 07:46.740
Our user creation is a success.

07:46.840 --> 07:54.400
And as you can see that AWOS has also given me the option to sign in within a different username and

07:54.400 --> 07:58.400
address with the URL they just showed me here.

07:58.690 --> 08:05.230
But since I don't have the programmatic access my users simply cannot do that.

08:05.240 --> 08:13.100
But just below that within the user section you can see that an access key and this secret key is already

08:13.100 --> 08:16.630
created for me from a W-S.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.680
Just expand this section.

08:18.800 --> 08:26.150
It says creative use or deployment attached policy as the administrate or access to user deployment

08:26.390 --> 08:30.420
and then created access key for user deployment.

08:30.440 --> 08:31.600
And here we go.

08:31.940 --> 08:34.450
I have my access key and secret key.

08:34.450 --> 08:35.770
Create it.

08:35.780 --> 08:44.270
So now all we have to do is just take a copy of these and keep them in a separate tap or separate application

08:44.270 --> 08:52.270
or a notepad or something so that we can use them later on when we try to configure our a WSC a lie.

08:52.370 --> 09:03.300
So let's do that now and I'm going to open up a text editor and I want a new document and also just

09:04.230 --> 09:10.800
access key as and the secret key

09:16.270 --> 09:20.850
Let's go back and select it and copied it.

09:23.010 --> 09:32.340
And here we go we have our access key and secret key created and taken into our notepad for later use.

09:32.340 --> 09:38.640
So let's go back to our AWOS castle for a second and you can see that there is a list a little button

09:38.640 --> 09:47.670
right here as saying the download C-s we file within this while you can see the access key secret keys

09:47.820 --> 09:52.200
and other useful information about your user on AWOS.

09:52.230 --> 09:57.270
You can get a nice little table about your AWOS user.

09:57.480 --> 10:03.330
So that's all for creating access key and secret key on AWOS.

10:03.360 --> 10:10.710
So let's recap our steps and first thing we had to do was to create a user for our purpose.

10:10.710 --> 10:17.540
And after that we have to attach a policy for that user specifying the level of access.

10:17.560 --> 10:24.810
Either the administrators level or a like a guest level read only our full right level.

10:24.810 --> 10:31.120
We have to specify the policy for accessing resources on a W-S.

10:31.310 --> 10:39.410
After attaching the policy to our user we have to specify the access level like the console based our

10:39.530 --> 10:46.940
programmatic or simply both of those access levels we have to pick either of them or none of them.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.600
That's the basic idea.

10:48.710 --> 10:55.070
We have to know the purpose of our user first and after we select everything we have to just simply

10:55.070 --> 11:02.480
give the name of our user and we can just simply create it once we finished with creation as you can

11:02.480 --> 11:10.160
see within the screen a W-S gives us a nice little overview of our user specifying our access key and

11:10.160 --> 11:10.960
secret key.

11:11.060 --> 11:11.650
That's all.
