WEBVTT

00:03.180 --> 00:10.290
So probably the most important part in the scores is to have an AWOS account where you can play around

00:10.290 --> 00:17.190
with AWOS resources that we're going to do in this lecture and all the following lectures.

00:17.610 --> 00:25.050
So to do that we first have to go to AWOS console but to get there of course we have to create an account.

00:25.050 --> 00:29.870
We have to sign up to AWOS so to do that.

00:29.910 --> 00:36.290
Our starting point is YES A W-S that Amazon Dot com.

00:36.450 --> 00:44.870
So after we launched this Web site we can see that we have a real nice presentation of AWOS services

00:44.940 --> 00:48.660
and what's going on around A W-S in general.

00:48.660 --> 00:54.950
So we have all the flashy new services from Amazon and they're just advertising them.

00:55.050 --> 01:04.200
And after that we have the Amazon subheads events and other things about A W-S and if we go down below

01:04.380 --> 01:11.190
we have descriptions of AWOS services products and everything about AWOS.

01:11.460 --> 01:20.190
And after we go down below a little further we have some customers that are running on AWOS and you

01:20.190 --> 01:25.420
can see that there are just simply big guys running on A W-S.

01:25.440 --> 01:26.210
All right.

01:27.040 --> 01:37.120
So to create an AWOS account to sign up to A W-S I'll go click on the yellow button right on the top

01:37.120 --> 01:38.210
corner.

01:38.230 --> 01:46.660
So in your case this might be signed into a WS console but in my case since I previously went there

01:46.960 --> 01:52.510
it is saying that I have to complete this process so all had complete Sign-Up

01:55.770 --> 02:01.390
and I have the usual log in page for AWOS.

02:01.440 --> 02:05.250
So in our case we're going to be creating in a W-S account.

02:05.340 --> 02:13.320
So let's go down below and hit create a new AWOS account.

02:13.330 --> 02:14.600
All right.

02:14.600 --> 02:19.320
We here are creating a WS account presented to us.

02:19.490 --> 02:28.910
And one thing to note in this page is that AWOS has 12 months of free tier access for most of the AWOS

02:28.910 --> 02:32.740
services simply the most popular services are AWOS.

02:32.840 --> 02:41.600
So we can say that easy to Esrey dynamo D.B and a couple of other services are available for free tier

02:41.600 --> 02:43.940
access in AWOS.

02:44.360 --> 02:53.810
So to check them out let's just go to this web page AWOS Amazon Dot com slash free to see what services

02:54.080 --> 02:57.710
are available to us in our free tier access.

02:57.770 --> 03:08.440
So if we go down below we have 12 months of free and always free products and we have simply sold 50

03:08.440 --> 03:10.720
hours of easy to use.

03:10.960 --> 03:22.380
We have a 1 gigabyte of kook site five gigabytes of Esrey 750 hours of our D.S. 1 million free requests

03:22.470 --> 03:25.960
with a W-S Lamda and much more.

03:26.430 --> 03:34.410
So using a free tier is always beneficial for you because simply your learning to do things with AWOS

03:34.470 --> 03:41.190
and you're not being charged of anything until you reach your point in your account and it is just not

03:41.190 --> 03:43.020
so simple to reach out.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.340
All right.

03:44.340 --> 03:50.970
After we check out this page let's go back to our sign up process and I'm going to start by typing in

03:50.970 --> 04:02.260
my e-mail address.

04:02.420 --> 04:09.650
I have to type a password adhering to the credentials that they showed me here.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.800
So I'll just type something

04:20.860 --> 04:25.520
and the AWOS account name is going to be the display name of your account.

04:25.520 --> 04:32.700
So if your name is like John Doe and then you can simply say John Doe.

04:32.710 --> 04:34.360
All right.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.340
And let's hit continue

04:40.330 --> 04:48.130
and Amazon is asking for the contact information for like billing and other processes.

04:48.370 --> 04:54.190
So you have to specify that if you're going to use his account as a professional account like for a

04:54.190 --> 04:59.590
business are you can specify that you're using this account for personal use.

04:59.590 --> 05:03.870
So in our case I'll be using it for personal purposes.

05:03.910 --> 05:13.880
So I'll just select personal and I have to specify things like country address city state and postal

05:13.880 --> 05:20.190
code simply because they might have to send me bills about my AWOS usage.

05:20.450 --> 05:31.100
So let's just start in and filling in the.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.350
And I will type my address

05:40.610 --> 05:44.150
and city and state

05:54.740 --> 06:01.210
and finally I have to click to accept the terms and conditions from a WS.

06:01.310 --> 06:05.730
And if you want to write that out you can simply click on this link and check it out.

06:05.750 --> 06:16.730
But I'll just click on the checkbox right now and create account and continue.

06:16.750 --> 06:17.410
All right.

06:18.720 --> 06:26.400
This time a W-S is asking for my credit card information simply because again if I reached the limits

06:26.400 --> 06:33.200
of my free tier account usage AWOS might have to charge me for some usages of AWOS services.

06:33.300 --> 06:39.390
So in that case they are just simply needing my credit card so that they can charge me.

06:39.810 --> 06:48.220
So you have to type in your credit card information your name your expiration date and so on.

06:48.340 --> 06:54.980
And after you finish them you'll simply have to use the secure submit.

06:55.150 --> 07:02.710
After that when you submit your credit card and every other information finally AWOS is going to ask

07:02.710 --> 07:11.010
for your telephone number you simply have to specify or phone number in a format that you have to use

07:11.020 --> 07:18.920
the country code as the prefix so in my case for Turkey I have to specify plys 90.

07:18.930 --> 07:27.340
Then my phone number and after I hit next in the section Amazon is going to place me a call actual call

07:27.340 --> 07:28.660
to my phone.

07:28.660 --> 07:37.350
So in that call they're going to ask for a code that they showed me in the sign up process so the code

07:37.360 --> 07:43.870
that they're going to show is on the next page actually wants I provide my telephone number.

07:43.990 --> 07:50.890
They're going to do me a code four digit code for a WSI sign up process.

07:50.890 --> 07:57.490
So once I get that code they're going to ask me that card when they place me a call.

07:57.490 --> 08:05.890
So within the call I'm going to be typing the four digit code with the keypad of my phone and once I've

08:05.890 --> 08:11.890
finished that they're going to say that your verification is complete and the web page is going to be

08:11.890 --> 08:12.820
refreshed.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.190
So it is going to say the sign up is complete and successful.

08:19.370 --> 08:27.860
So that is basically all about signing up to A W-S is not a real hard process but it's just simply too

08:27.860 --> 08:30.650
elaborate and sometimes maybe tiring.

08:30.920 --> 08:37.010
So of course you have to specify your credit card and telephone numbers so that they can verify that

08:37.040 --> 08:39.670
you are a real person and a bot or something.

08:39.830 --> 08:45.760
So this is just the usual process on signing up to AWOS.

08:45.850 --> 08:52.900
I highly encourage you to do it as soon as possible and maybe while watching this video because otherwise

08:53.170 --> 08:58.220
you can follow up the lectures with me along the Python and Bothell 3.

08:58.270 --> 09:02.530
While we're managing A W-S resources within our code.
