WEBVTT

00:02.380 --> 00:10.210
Before we begin downloading tools and preparing our environment for development for A W-S Let's take

00:10.210 --> 00:15.810
a look at what we're going to cover in the section in this section.

00:15.830 --> 00:20.580
We'll take a look at our development tools and environment.

00:20.630 --> 00:29.540
This is basically the idea is Python versions installing Bothell library on Python and everything related

00:29.540 --> 00:36.660
to that of course we're going to take a taste of a WSC a lie.

00:36.680 --> 00:44.730
Let me try to configure our A WOSM moment on our machines for access keys and secret keys and reagents

00:46.050 --> 00:52.600
and of course we're going to take a moment to download and install Python on our machines.

00:55.980 --> 01:01.910
And after we how Python on our machines we're of course going to have our ID.

01:01.920 --> 01:11.510
And again I recommend you use pi charm since it has a both free edition and a professional version.

01:11.580 --> 01:20.820
You can just go to Jepp brains and download it then of course both of three is our main ingredient in

01:20.820 --> 01:25.680
the score and I'll of course show you how to get it and how to use it.

01:27.140 --> 01:33.920
The operating system part of the score is important because in the following lectures there will be

01:34.310 --> 01:39.730
dedicated videos about installing tools on Windows or Mac OS.

01:39.980 --> 01:47.770
So depending on your operating system choose a video to install the tools and set up your environment

01:48.110 --> 01:51.290
and you just can skip the other ones.

01:51.290 --> 01:58.700
So in that case if you're a Mac user you can just simply skip the window sections of the videos.

02:00.980 --> 02:07.800
And after we have our implement already I'll show you how to create an AWOS account.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.650
If you don't have it already.

02:09.800 --> 02:17.870
But again I highly encourage you to take a moment to prepare an AWOS account and get it free because

02:18.380 --> 02:21.400
it has a free tier for up to one year.

02:21.410 --> 02:28.510
So this is a very great opportunity from A W-S.

02:28.760 --> 02:37.970
And after we how are a W-S account ready will log into A W-S console and take a walk through it.

02:38.090 --> 02:41.360
I'll be showing you the easy to section.

02:41.450 --> 02:49.450
And of course the PC section primarily and of course we're going to take your general walkthrough of

02:50.060 --> 02:53.090
some of the important parts of AWOS

02:56.600 --> 03:04.500
And when we finish walking through the AWOS console we're going to be creating a development user Ferraro

03:04.520 --> 03:09.430
account and we're going to be obtaining our AWOS credentials.

03:09.440 --> 03:17.870
So these are going to be access Keys and Key is of course we're going to create our own keys and we're

03:17.870 --> 03:22.690
going to be configuring them using a WSC rely on our machines.

03:22.730 --> 03:27.550
So all a showing in that exact steps to.

03:27.710 --> 03:34.410
And again we're going to be setting up our moment using a WSC alive and I'll be showing me all the steps

03:34.410 --> 03:41.220
and modeling that and I'll be explaining you how to set region and how to set your access keys and secret

03:41.220 --> 03:41.730
keys.
