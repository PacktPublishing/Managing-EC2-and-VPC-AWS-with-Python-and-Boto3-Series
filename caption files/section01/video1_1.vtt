Hi welcome to my course on A W-S with Python and both are three managing easy to end BPC as being the

00:11.800 --> 00:20.640
first of the series of courses for AWOS and this one we're going to be focusing on easy 2 and BPC.

00:21.010 --> 00:27.830
We're going to be launching our own Witchell private cloud environment using Python and both three.

00:28.180 --> 00:35.690
And after that we're going to be launching subnets and you see two instances on them.

00:35.810 --> 00:42.170
We're going to have public accessible easy to do and we're of course going to have a private easy to

00:42.170 --> 00:44.370
instance.

00:44.540 --> 00:49.940
We're going to be doing all these programmatically and not a single one manually.

00:50.270 --> 00:55.780
So this is a very hands on course and I'm happy that you decided to take this course with me.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.640
I'm really excited that you're going to learn a lot from this course both about Python both of three

01:02.700 --> 01:09.140
and managing a resources using S-D case especially with Python.

01:09.150 --> 01:16.050
And both are three again so without further ado let's go check out what we're going to cover in this

01:16.070 --> 01:17.030
course in detail.
