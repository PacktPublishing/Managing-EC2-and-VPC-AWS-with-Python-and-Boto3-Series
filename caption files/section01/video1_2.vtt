00:02.320 --> 00:05.370
Now let's take a look at what we're going to cover in the course.

00:06.550 --> 00:14.220
And this course will work with AWOS using Python and both are three API.

00:14.650 --> 00:22.750
Python is becoming very popular with managing AWOS resources and both are three years on top of it is

00:22.750 --> 00:32.170
a great library for managing AWOS clients and resources from easy to instances to PCs Lobello answers

00:32.440 --> 00:42.370
and everything about AWOS you can simply manage everything using both a 3 and Python for AWOS And of

00:42.370 --> 00:44.590
course I'll explain everything.

00:44.770 --> 00:49.070
But it's nice to know what we PC and easy to beforehand.

00:49.600 --> 00:56.860
So I'm guessing that you're familiar with AWOS concepts about the PC and easy to and what they are standing

00:56.860 --> 01:07.320
for and I'll be really happy if you have some idea on what they are and how we can use them on a console.

01:07.330 --> 01:12.450
And of course most importantly this is a very hands on course.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.620
We're going to be developing everything from scratch using Python.

01:16.780 --> 01:19.330
And both are three on AWOS.

01:19.390 --> 01:24.700
We're going to be creating our credentials for deployment and then we're going to start our project

01:24.790 --> 01:33.040
in PI charme ID from Jet brains and then we're going to be making use of both all three and Python to

01:33.040 --> 01:39.580
connect to a W-S and we're going to start implementing our architecture which we're going to be taking

01:39.580 --> 01:42.730
a look at in the next lecture.

01:42.800 --> 01:49.380
And again we're going to be developing our own AWOS solution from scratch with Python and both are three.

01:49.520 --> 01:56.480
This is really important because you can use these kind of solutions in everywhere from your personal

01:56.540 --> 02:01.210
ambitious projects to production grade actual work projects.

02:01.340 --> 02:04.070
You can make use of this information anywhere.

02:04.520 --> 02:09.300
And I'd like to stress that again will not do anything manually.

02:09.300 --> 02:11.880
It's all will be automated with Python.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.080
And both are three.

02:13.220 --> 02:20.420
This is very important because otherwise we can simply go into and log into a W-S console and make all

02:20.420 --> 02:22.760
these manually by hand.

02:22.940 --> 02:28.640
We can type everything in there and we can manually create it but we don't want that.

02:28.880 --> 02:35.810
We want to have a code base that we can use and reuse again because this way is the way that we should

02:35.810 --> 02:37.880
be following these days.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.080
All right.

02:39.080 --> 02:46.160
Now is the time to take a look at what we're actually going to be developing into score's the architectural

02:46.160 --> 02:51.010
diagram of what we're going to be seeing in the lectures and throughout the course.

02:51.870 --> 02:57.050
So let's go over to the next lecture and I'll be showing you what we're going to be building in this

02:57.060 --> 02:57.700
course.
