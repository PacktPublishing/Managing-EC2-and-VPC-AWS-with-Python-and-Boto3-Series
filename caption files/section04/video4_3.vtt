00:00.770 --> 00:08.840
Know what we have to do is we have to reconfigure our HWC lie with our secret key an access key.

00:08.840 --> 00:11.640
The way to do that is quite simple.

00:11.690 --> 00:19.880
So what I'm going to do now since I have the access key and secret key taken into a separate notepad

00:20.090 --> 00:22.460
so I can just copy and paste it.

00:22.700 --> 00:26.090
I'm going to use the AWOS configure command.

00:26.090 --> 00:34.890
So I'll say AWOS configure and then I'm simply going to hit enter right now.

00:36.110 --> 00:41.830
So AWOS Seelye is first asking for the access key from me.

00:42.020 --> 00:51.000
Let's just copy and paste it and hit enter and then it's asking for the secret access key.

00:51.140 --> 00:56.520
Let's just copy it and paste it to our command line.

00:58.700 --> 01:01.890
And it is asking for the default region.

01:02.450 --> 01:05.810
We can specify and not a region anytime we want.

01:05.810 --> 01:13.520
But in this case if you want to operate with the WSC allied directly we have to specify a region.

01:13.520 --> 01:24.110
So in our case I'm going to say EU central one or simply franc for the default or put format as the

01:24.200 --> 01:32.180
format that you received the response from a WSC ally operations or requests underscoring to say it's

01:32.180 --> 01:34.020
going to be Jason.

01:34.640 --> 01:35.840
And here we go.

01:36.550 --> 01:44.830
Our AWOS Seelye is configured with the access key and secret key that we just created from our I am

01:44.830 --> 01:47.400
user from our AWOS consol.

01:47.410 --> 01:52.810
So now we're due to work with AWOS API.

01:52.880 --> 01:59.830
The next thing we're going to do is we're going to install the both of three library on our Python installation.
