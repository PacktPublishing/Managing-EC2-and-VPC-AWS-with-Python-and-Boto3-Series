The next thing we need to do is we need to install the both of three library for our Python project.

00:09.180 --> 00:14.030
The way to do that is of course using the Python package manager which is Pipp.

00:14.070 --> 00:23.120
So let's just type and PIREP 3.6 since I'm using the third version for Python.

00:23.130 --> 00:31.590
And of course the Python package manager I'm going to say Pipp for you and install and then both of

00:31.610 --> 00:37.580
three and I'm going to hit enter and both are three.

00:37.630 --> 00:42.690
As already installed just like that so fast.

00:42.880 --> 00:50.530
So I'm almost ready to work with AWOS and his API with my Python project.
