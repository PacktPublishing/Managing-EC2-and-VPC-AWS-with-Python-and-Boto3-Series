00:00.910 --> 00:07.510
Before you start working on our project and our implementation list as we drove by that if we have everything

00:07.510 --> 00:10.370
set up and everything is in place.

00:10.510 --> 00:14.840
So let's first verify that we have the python installation.

00:15.010 --> 00:19.160
So let's just type in Python 3.6.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.490
And here we go.

00:20.650 --> 00:28.780
We have the Python 3 that 6.5 interpreter coming into us with the command line with the terminal on

00:28.780 --> 00:30.100
Mac OS.

00:30.160 --> 00:40.410
So let's just exit from there and let's just rarified that we have the J-ws CLID configured as we expected.

00:41.080 --> 00:50.920
And if we try to execute the AWOS configure command we're going to see that the last part of our AWOS

00:50.950 --> 00:53.060
accessory that we just couldn't figure out.

00:53.230 --> 01:00.550
And if I hit enter and keep it that way I'm going to see the last part of the secret access key again

01:01.000 --> 01:09.870
and then I'm going to see the central one region that just I sent I said from the previous lecture.

01:10.120 --> 01:16.460
And if I hit enter again I'm going to see the default format for all put is Jaser.

01:16.930 --> 01:24.810
So we have our AWOS Selye a double U.S. secret key in the Access Key is configured as we expected.

01:24.820 --> 01:31.420
So let's just verify that we have the both of 3 library installed on our Python.

01:31.420 --> 01:38.250
So to do that I'm going to say pay up 3.6 and Shaw.

01:38.860 --> 01:48.130
Also free and as you can see we have the $1.7 to version of both of three library.

01:48.290 --> 01:56.820
And it says the A W-S web services and the Python package manager AWOS SDK for Python.

01:57.470 --> 02:05.630
So we have everything in place and we are now ready to work with our Python project on AWOS resources

02:05.630 --> 02:07.730
like BPC and E.S. to.
