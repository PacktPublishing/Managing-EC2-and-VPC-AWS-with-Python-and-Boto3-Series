00:00.620 --> 00:08.720
So now it's time to install the a WSC a lie so that we can easily configure our access keys in secret

00:08.720 --> 00:17.150
keys so that we can access AWOS resources from command lines applications other languages and simply

00:17.150 --> 00:21.190
from everywhere on our machine to do that.

00:21.200 --> 00:25.240
Of course there are several ways of achieving this goal.

00:25.280 --> 00:35.150
You can simply install with Peppe and you can simply download the package for a WSC ally and by far

00:35.330 --> 00:45.260
the easiest way to install a WSC lie on Mac OS is with homebrew homebrew is the missing package manager

00:45.260 --> 00:46.730
on Mac OS.

00:46.730 --> 00:52.370
If you go to its Web site and let's just type in homebrew

00:54.780 --> 00:58.110
and if we go check it out.

00:58.260 --> 01:02.940
It is simply the missing package manager for Mac OS.

01:02.940 --> 01:10.560
The best part of homebrew is you don't have to deal with the path variables and setting the executables

01:10.560 --> 01:13.660
so that you can work with them in your command lines.

01:13.920 --> 01:20.760
Homebrewed just takes care of everything so you just simply call the command like just the Brue install

01:20.820 --> 01:23.400
and a WSC apply in our case.

01:23.490 --> 01:31.620
Dan you just have the AWOS Seelye ready for your command line for any application that you have.

01:31.710 --> 01:42.830
Again you can just simply go and check the AWOS apply for Mac OS on a WSS original web site.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.160
This is the another option to install a WSC.

01:47.190 --> 01:54.010
But it has some downsides because you have to export the path because it doesn't work all the time.

01:54.060 --> 02:02.190
When you install it with Pipp and package managers so I'm going to follow the way of using the homebrew

02:02.430 --> 02:05.160
for a WSC applies to lation.

02:05.340 --> 02:16.350
So I'm going to go back to my terminal so I'm going to type pin Ru install AWOS lie just like that

02:19.310 --> 02:21.970
and homebrew is updating itself.

02:23.090 --> 02:30.620
And then it's going to install my a WSC ally with along with the all of the Pender's see that it has

02:32.620 --> 02:44.160
so are AWOS Seelye is being installed with of course the dependencies that it needs to operate properly.

02:44.280 --> 02:45.620
And here we go.

02:45.990 --> 02:50.260
Our AWOS Theola is now ready and up and running.

02:50.280 --> 02:52.160
Let's just test it out.

02:52.320 --> 02:57.360
So I'm going to type in a W-S and here we go.

02:57.450 --> 03:01.230
Our AWOS is now working as expected.
