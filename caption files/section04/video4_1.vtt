00:01.460 --> 00:10.910
On Mac OS first thing we need to do is install Python 3 and pay package manager for Pitre for doing

00:10.910 --> 00:11.500
that.

00:12.780 --> 00:13.790
Python.

00:14.010 --> 00:15.350
Dot org.

00:18.260 --> 00:30.750
And from there under the downloads section let's just select the python 3.0 65 for Mac OS and our package

00:30.760 --> 00:32.550
is now being downloaded

00:40.560 --> 00:46.380
let's click on our package and let's just install Python for Mac OS

00:49.330 --> 00:52.160
and I'll hit next.

00:52.290 --> 01:03.120
And after the license agreement I'll hit next and Except And let's just customize it for a moment and

01:03.990 --> 01:09.380
I'm going to install Python package manager PIREP along with Python 3.

01:09.630 --> 01:19.080
I want the documentation I want the shell integration for python under my path for Mac OS and I'll just

01:19.080 --> 01:26.850
hit install and I'm going to type in my password.

01:27.020 --> 01:31.460
And here we go our Python 3 is now installed.

01:32.640 --> 01:38.420
As you can see here and I can simply just put it there.

01:38.440 --> 01:46.750
Trash the installer and as you can see we have the launcher Python automatically presented to us on

01:46.750 --> 01:48.230
our Mac OS.

01:48.580 --> 01:50.490
But to where dat.

01:50.690 --> 01:53.480
Let's open up a terminal session.

01:58.210 --> 02:03.100
And from there I'm just going to type in Python.

02:03.880 --> 02:13.750
And from the python we can see that our Python is showing us the default Python installation on Mac

02:13.750 --> 02:14.690
OS.

02:14.860 --> 02:19.150
But we're of course asking for the Python 3.

02:19.180 --> 02:26.720
So let's just accept this and I'm going to type in Python tree dot 6.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.520
And here we go.

02:30.600 --> 02:38.320
We can access the python 3.6 from our macros command line just like this way.

02:40.090 --> 02:45.510
Now let's just where to find the Pipp installation on our Mac OS.

02:46.840 --> 02:52.940
And for that purpose I'm simply going to type in as Pip.

02:53.200 --> 03:00.280
Of course when we tried to type in the pip command and tried to launch the Python package manager it

03:00.310 --> 03:08.230
automatically went back to Python to 7 on our default installation on Mac OS.

03:08.290 --> 03:12.230
But we want the Python 3 that's 6 Peppe.

03:12.280 --> 03:17.190
So we have to type in pipe 3 that 6.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.440
And here we go.

03:18.610 --> 03:23.590
We have the Piep Python package manager installed on Mac OS.
