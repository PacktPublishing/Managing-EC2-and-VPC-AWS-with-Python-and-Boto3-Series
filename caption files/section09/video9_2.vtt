00:01.220 --> 00:03.680
So we're about to finish with our course.

00:03.800 --> 00:11.130
But before we wrap things all up and before we close this thing before we finish this course let's take

00:11.130 --> 00:14.230
out what comes next what comes after the scores.

00:14.270 --> 00:19.940
And I hope you enjoyed this implementation and everything about their scores.

00:19.940 --> 00:24.020
So you're ready to move on with more of AWOS.

00:24.140 --> 00:27.190
So let's see what's going to come next to you.

00:27.200 --> 00:32.320
So discours is a part of a series of courses on A W-S.

00:32.330 --> 00:40.280
So this is not just a single cause I'm working on the next chapters of this cause for other AWOS resources.

00:40.790 --> 00:44.160
And again this is the first part of that series.

00:44.240 --> 00:51.350
So there's going to be a lot of courses on a US so that you can learn how to implement how to work with

00:51.410 --> 01:00.200
AWOS resources and how to launch your AWOS infrastructure from your code with Python both 3 and some

01:00.260 --> 01:01.500
other libraries.

01:02.880 --> 01:10.860
So I believe you want more on a WS since you joined us because I'm sure that you are more on AWOS because

01:11.410 --> 01:19.340
AWOS is quite popular these days as it has always been since at large in 2006.

01:19.340 --> 01:27.610
So wanting more of a double as is perfectly normal and it's just great because AWOS has the extensive

01:27.610 --> 01:31.020
resources about simply everything.

01:31.420 --> 01:38.510
They have services from very basic stuff to quite complex things like Kuber and 80s.

01:38.830 --> 01:42.880
Yes by Nemo D-B RDX and much more.

01:42.950 --> 01:48.990
So knowing deep stuff and knowing how to implement them is quite critical.

01:49.770 --> 01:55.230
In your jobs and simply in most of the enterprises these days.

01:55.230 --> 02:04.070
So I get you and I want to provide you the best in class training on a W-S plus Python Plus both are

02:04.080 --> 02:12.730
three and much more of the libraries so more of the AWOS Python and both all three courses will come

02:12.730 --> 02:13.550
to you soon.

02:13.690 --> 02:15.620
So stay tuned for it.

02:16.550 --> 02:27.920
The topics of those courses include but not only AWOS Lamda dynamo d r d s s s s and s and much more.

02:28.040 --> 02:36.440
So please stay tuned for my next courses and I'll be making the announcements when I launch the other

02:36.440 --> 02:39.740
parts of my courses on AWOS resources.
