All right we've come to the end of our course on A W-S Python and both all three and I hope you enjoyed

00:08.850 --> 00:14.070
this course and everything that we implemented and learned throughout the course.

00:14.070 --> 00:21.810
So again we all learned how to implement VPC subnets and launching easy to instances between them.

00:21.840 --> 00:25.230
So I hope you enjoyed this course again.

00:25.470 --> 00:30.200
I'm expecting to see you in my next courses on AWOS resources.

00:30.270 --> 00:37.610
Again those topics include a AWOS lambda Dynamo the b s s s n as are these.

00:37.650 --> 00:39.660
Yes and much more of that.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.650
So stay tuned for my next courses.

00:42.840 --> 00:46.360
And I'm hoping to see you again in my next courses.
