00:01.270 --> 00:09.780
Are right after this very long section let's take a look at what we've done in this section in this

00:09.780 --> 00:10.860
section.

00:10.860 --> 00:15.520
We took a look at what we're going to build on A W-S console.

00:15.540 --> 00:22.530
We had a perspective on what we're going to build as with the the PC Internet gateways subnets and so

00:22.530 --> 00:24.060
on.

00:24.060 --> 00:32.940
And after that we prepared our Python environment as being the library setting on the Python Id our

00:32.960 --> 00:42.660
pie chart ID and Dan we created our project with PI chime or the after that we discovered the very extenso

00:42.660 --> 00:47.780
Bothell 3 documentation on read the docs that I know.

00:47.970 --> 00:55.380
And again this is a highly qualified documentation from those guys that both know the implementers of

00:55.380 --> 01:00.990
the library and big shout out to them for providing such a great documentation.

01:00.990 --> 01:07.410
You should definitely go and check it out sometimes to get a feeling of a good documentation and finding

01:07.410 --> 01:10.060
your way around a AWOS resources.

01:11.130 --> 01:19.550
And after that you provided an auto complete capability to our PI charme ID with the huge help of Pi

01:19.560 --> 01:21.960
both those three.

01:22.160 --> 01:29.950
And then we started on to create our resources and we first created a PC.

01:30.040 --> 01:39.250
After that we created an Internet Gateway or EGW and then we attached this internet gateway to our PC

01:39.910 --> 01:48.010
and we were all done that using the Python and both of three libraries to move on with our implementations

01:48.040 --> 01:54.550
as implementing subnets and their route tables and other resources.

01:54.960 --> 01:56.630
I'll be seeing you on the next video.
