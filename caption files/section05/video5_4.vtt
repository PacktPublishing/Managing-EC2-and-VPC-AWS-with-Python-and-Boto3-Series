00:00.980 --> 00:09.670
One less thing to check out before we move on to our implementation is to resources to both of three.

00:09.920 --> 00:18.050
Both of three has very extensive documentation on the methods and the library itself since it is being

00:18.050 --> 00:20.750
maintained by Amazon itself.

00:20.990 --> 00:28.550
Both of three has a great documentation and as you can see here you can get the documentation about

00:28.580 --> 00:31.730
all the available libraries on both those three.

00:31.790 --> 00:41.060
And again I should note that any library any service that is available on A W-S is instantly available

00:41.210 --> 00:42.760
with both of three.

00:42.980 --> 00:44.000
Simple as that.

00:44.180 --> 00:52.730
Both are three again has a very extensive documentation and if we check out the documentation for Easy

00:52.730 --> 01:01.880
to and let's click on it and then you can see that you can have the resources created and the sample

01:01.880 --> 01:07.790
code is right below the documentation page.

01:07.940 --> 01:15.320
It's really important to use this documentation because you have everything you need to create A W-S

01:15.320 --> 01:19.690
resources and you have it all right here on the.

01:19.760 --> 01:28.840
Both all three dot read the docs that know make sure to check this website and make sure to take a peek

01:29.050 --> 01:30.510
whenever you need to.

01:30.640 --> 01:33.670
While using a W-S with both of three.
