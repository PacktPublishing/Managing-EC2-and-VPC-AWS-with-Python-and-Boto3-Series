Creating internet gateway Let's go back to our BPC class within the PC class.

00:09.320 --> 00:15.700
And of course we have a mistyping right here and here we go.

00:15.710 --> 00:23.160
So what we're going to do now is we're going to provide a little method to create an internet gateway

00:23.570 --> 00:29.020
so I'll just say create Internet Gateway

00:31.700 --> 00:40.700
and within that method let's just first try to type and the method and see what we're going to have

00:40.700 --> 00:46.680
to provide create internet gateway.

00:47.030 --> 00:54.910
And as you can see except from the dry run method which is just for like relevation purposes for a W-S

00:54.920 --> 00:57.560
calls we don't have to provide anything.

00:57.650 --> 01:01.220
It doesn't have a base of property at all.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.900
So we can just call this method like this.

01:03.950 --> 01:18.530
And of course let's just type in a command type in a command line output as creating and internet gateway.

01:19.310 --> 01:21.510
And here we go.

01:21.530 --> 01:31.970
So the next thing would be to call this method from our main class and I'm going go down here create

01:32.150 --> 01:43.910
an G.V. or internet gateway and we're just going to call our method BPC dot create internet gateway

01:46.090 --> 01:54.580
so that's all we need to do to create an Internet Gateway within a PCM worriment But of course we have

01:54.580 --> 02:02.950
to take the response from a couple of us so that we can make use of it while attaching it to the PC.

02:03.010 --> 02:13.670
So I'm going to say I G.V. response is this.

02:13.690 --> 02:18.730
Eric go to attach the internet gateway to our real PC.

02:18.850 --> 02:20.750
I'll be seeing you on the next video.
