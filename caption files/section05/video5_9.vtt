00:02.270 --> 00:07.300
All right we have our internet gateway create it.

00:07.310 --> 00:16.420
So the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to attach this internet gateway to our PC so

00:16.600 --> 00:23.950
to do that we're going to take out the Internet Gateway ID from the internet gateway response and then

00:24.280 --> 00:30.530
we're going to use that ID to attach the in a gateway to our PC.

00:30.760 --> 00:40.460
But of course to get the internet gateway idea let's go back to both of three documentation and from

00:40.460 --> 00:44.220
the both of the free documentation.

00:44.440 --> 00:50.140
Let's find the method for creating the internet gateway.

00:50.230 --> 00:56.740
And here we go and let's see what it returns so we can get the internet gateway ID.

00:57.190 --> 01:04.240
And as you can see it is returning a type of dictionary and then with the internet gateway object at

01:04.240 --> 01:09.360
the parent level then we have the internet gateway ID.

01:09.510 --> 01:21.590
So let's just copy the Internet Gateway and after our response let's say Internet Gateway ID is going

01:21.590 --> 01:22.040
to be

01:26.320 --> 01:32.720
internet gateway response and then the internet gateway ID.

01:32.920 --> 01:37.200
And after that following the object response structure

01:39.630 --> 01:43.870
internet gateway Id just like that.

01:44.200 --> 01:52.470
So this is going to give us the necessary information for retrieving the internet gateway ID.

01:52.540 --> 02:00.360
The next thing that we're going to do is to attach the internet gateway to our PC.

02:00.490 --> 02:05.270
Let's go to our C-Class and create a method.

02:05.890 --> 02:10.720
So I'll go down below and I'm going to define a method.

02:11.500 --> 02:23.780
Attach internet gateway to the PC opes and Eurico.

02:23.950 --> 02:34.340
And what this method is going to get is of course a PC ID and an internet gateway ID.

02:35.100 --> 02:46.350
So if we tried to type the method using with the help of Pi both a library and attach internet gateway

02:46.800 --> 02:54.360
to the PC and as you can see it is expecting basically two things except the dry run of course it is

02:54.360 --> 02:56.650
expecting an internet gateway ID.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.910
And then of course a VPC ID.

03:00.060 --> 03:05.550
So let's just provide those methods those Arden's actually.

03:05.550 --> 03:17.240
And I'm going to say Internet Gateway ID is going to be IGAD And let's just go a line below and see

03:17.240 --> 03:20.150
what we're doing more clearly.

03:20.150 --> 03:29.480
And then of course we're going to have to provide the PC ID and for that I'm going to say the PC Id

03:29.540 --> 03:30.890
just like that.

03:31.760 --> 03:39.230
And of course let's just print out the statement that we're attaching the internet gateway to our CPC

03:43.740 --> 03:58.340
internet gateway and of course provide the ID for internet gateway and then to be PC and PPC ID.

03:59.110 --> 04:01.180
All right.

04:01.360 --> 04:09.580
So let's go back to our main test in class my implementation class and just typed a method then.

04:09.580 --> 04:19.990
So we're going to say the PC got attach AGW to VPC and the first thing that we're going to provide is

04:19.990 --> 04:29.190
the PC ID and then we're going to provide the internet gateway Id just like that.

04:29.200 --> 04:34.840
So this is all we have to do to attach our internet gateway to the PC.
