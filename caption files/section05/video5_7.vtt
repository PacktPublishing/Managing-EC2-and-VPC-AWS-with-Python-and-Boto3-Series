00:02.020 --> 00:05.720
In our previous lecture we created a VPC.

00:06.220 --> 00:14.080
But to state that again we're going to be developing our application until the end then we're going

00:14.080 --> 00:17.610
to launch everything at once with our application.

00:19.010 --> 00:29.030
So as you saw with our BPC creation as you can see Amazon is not giving the PC an option to provide

00:29.090 --> 00:30.420
a name.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.170
You have to provide the name for your replies.

00:33.410 --> 00:42.320
After you create or PPC this is somehow a weird way to give a name to your resource in a WSP PC.

00:42.360 --> 00:51.060
But anyways we will have to provide a name so that we can distinguish our ypc from the everything else.

00:51.170 --> 01:03.330
To do that there is a method in both of API our AWOS API to tag resources in easy to this Methodius

01:03.360 --> 01:05.020
create Tagamet it.

01:05.430 --> 01:13.500
So let's just write down a method within our PC so that we can use this method in a generic way to tag

01:13.590 --> 01:20.320
any of the resources that we want to attack within AWOS is the perspective.

01:20.370 --> 01:32.760
So I'm going to go down below and I'll say add name tag and this method is expecting a resource ID and

01:32.760 --> 01:34.520
or a resource name.

01:34.560 --> 01:39.280
Let me just type that method in and you're going to see what I'm trying to say.

01:40.820 --> 01:42.130
Self.

01:42.230 --> 01:46.470
Client create tags.

01:47.990 --> 01:56.210
And as you can see it is expecting a list of resources or resource IDs and Danni's is expecting also

01:56.320 --> 01:59.470
the tags that you want to attach to those resources.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.540
All right.

02:01.690 --> 02:12.620
So let's just get the resource ID because I'm going to attach the tags the to the resources one by one

02:13.220 --> 02:17.420
and also the resource name because we want to tap this resource.

02:17.530 --> 02:19.180
Its Name.

02:19.350 --> 02:25.970
So let's just apply the changes to our resources on J-ws.

02:26.020 --> 02:31.040
The first thing is the resources for the resources.

02:31.210 --> 02:34.410
The API is expecting a list of resources.

02:34.540 --> 02:41.890
But since we want to attach the tags or named resources one by one I'm just going to provide a list

02:41.950 --> 02:44.210
of one.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.980
And let's just provide elso the tax.

02:47.980 --> 02:55.640
The most important part of what we're going to provide and for the tax it is also expecting a list but

02:56.150 --> 03:03.200
within that list we have to be providing a multiple well-you elements so instead of that I'm going to

03:03.200 --> 03:05.860
provide a single dictionary.

03:06.080 --> 03:19.790
So I'm going to say the key for that task is going to be name of course and the value for that name

03:19.790 --> 03:24.860
tag is going to be the name of the resource.

03:24.890 --> 03:27.070
Simple as that.

03:27.220 --> 03:35.490
And let's just also print out a nice little message that we're adding a tag to a resource.

03:35.530 --> 03:46.420
So let's say adding resource name tak to the.

03:46.650 --> 03:55.660
And let's just provide the resource ID and seems like we have a typo there.

03:56.810 --> 03:59.060
And let's just fix all those

04:02.980 --> 04:07.130
and here we go.

04:07.170 --> 04:15.200
So the next thing we would do is we will take the response from the Create BPC method as we called with

04:15.200 --> 04:24.120
in here as the PC response we get from a of us as you can see and we're going to take the PC ID from

04:24.120 --> 04:31.940
that response and then we're going to attach the tag to that BPC as the name of it.

04:32.460 --> 04:45.320
So let's just go down below and let's just put a add name tag to the PC comment here and then what I'm

04:45.320 --> 04:49.170
going to do is I'm going to say BPC name.

04:50.180 --> 04:54.140
Yes going to be both.

04:54.220 --> 04:58.350
Three PC just like that.

04:59.220 --> 05:09.060
And the next thing that I want to do is I want to extract the the PC ID from the PC response and the

05:09.060 --> 05:15.930
way to do is as you can see here we're receiving a dictionary object in the Python language.

05:15.930 --> 05:24.900
So we first have to take the PC and then within that dictionary there is another dictionary and inside

05:24.900 --> 05:28.550
that dictionary we have the UPC ID.

05:28.560 --> 05:40.110
So what we're going to do is we're going to first get the VPC and then we're going to retrieve the BPC.

05:40.110 --> 05:42.840
Id just like that.

05:43.200 --> 05:49.870
This is going to give us the necessary information that we need to add the tag to the CPC.

05:49.890 --> 05:56.390
So the last thing we're going to do is we're going to call the ADD name tag method.

05:56.640 --> 06:05.010
And of course we're going to provide the BPC ID as the resource ID and for the name of course we're

06:05.010 --> 06:09.980
going to call it with the UPC name just like that.

06:10.020 --> 06:14.460
This is going to attach and name for our PC.

06:15.000 --> 06:25.250
And let's also print out added the PC name to

06:28.750 --> 06:34.070
and PC Id just like that.
