00:01.380 --> 00:05.140
All right I logged into my AWOS consol.

00:05.160 --> 00:11.670
And if you haven't done that already if you haven't signed then yet then you should do it now because

00:11.670 --> 00:14.140
we're going to check out what we're going to build on.

00:14.150 --> 00:17.210
AWOS All right.

00:18.120 --> 00:26.370
From the search bar right here I'm going to type in as we see and as you can see it is isolated cloud

00:26.370 --> 00:38.970
resources and within the BPC section as you can see there is already a default PC from Amazon or AWOS.

00:39.190 --> 00:42.610
This PPC is created by Amazon itself.

00:42.680 --> 00:51.000
So you should not touch this PC because if you do that you have to create a support ticket to a double

00:51.010 --> 00:59.270
you asked to have it created for you just keep it that way and leave that PC as is in our case.

00:59.390 --> 01:07.670
We're going to be creating a PC just like we can do it from the AWOS console itself like typing the

01:07.670 --> 01:15.740
name IP for block or the cyder block and providing us are well used to our Ribisi.

01:15.740 --> 01:22.080
We can definitely do that from a W-S console but we're going to do all these with Python.

01:22.430 --> 01:29.540
And after launching our PC we're going to take a look at these subnets and we're going to launch our

01:29.540 --> 01:38.870
own subnets to that PC and when we finish with our private and public subnets then we're going to go

01:38.870 --> 01:41.230
to Internet gateways.

01:41.780 --> 01:49.940
As you can see here from the internet gateway we're going to create and Gateway and then we're going

01:49.940 --> 01:58.040
to attach that internet get way to a subnet and that some net is going to belong to a PC that we created.

01:59.140 --> 02:03.820
Again we're going to do all of that using Python and both all three.

02:03.820 --> 02:10.030
We're not going to go to AWOS castle and try to type in to create something from there.

02:10.030 --> 02:12.730
We're going to do all of that within our code.

02:13.880 --> 02:18.790
So to start implementing our project I'll be seeing you on the next video.
