All right are you ready to get your hands dirty with AWOS using Python and both are three.

00:08.110 --> 00:11.470
Dan here is the time to do that.

00:11.530 --> 00:18.570
We're about to start our implementation for A W-S using Python and both are three of course in this

00:18.570 --> 00:19.290
section.

00:19.290 --> 00:25.630
We're going to be launching a PC and then we're going to be creating an internet gateway.

00:25.860 --> 00:33.810
And after that we're going to attach that internet gateway to our PC using a subset of that PCs so we're

00:33.810 --> 00:42.360
also going to create a subnet for our PC to check out what we're going to build on AWOS I'll be seeing

00:42.380 --> 00:43.470
you on the next video.
