00:02.980 --> 00:13.280
So now we know how to describe easy to instances but how about modifying those easy to instances to

00:13.280 --> 00:14.190
do that.

00:14.240 --> 00:17.360
I'm going to add another method right here.

00:17.420 --> 00:26.730
And I'm going to call it as modify C to instance and for the parameters I'm again leaving it as this

00:26.750 --> 00:27.970
to the side.

00:27.980 --> 00:32.840
After seeing the arguments and parameters modify

00:35.570 --> 00:44.690
instance attribute and as you can see duros several options for modifying attributes of an EASY TO instance

00:45.020 --> 00:50.950
from the changing the reserve instances changing the instance placement.

00:51.140 --> 00:59.540
But most importantly changing the instance attributes is the most extenso method on a W-S for modifying

00:59.540 --> 01:05.320
an easy to instance let's hit enter to see what we're going to have to provide.

01:05.450 --> 01:11.540
And as you can see excerpt from the dry run method right on argument actually we have lots of things

01:11.540 --> 01:19.610
to provide for this method but again none of all these arguments are required to decide on what we're

01:19.610 --> 01:22.730
going to have to provide and what we can modify.

01:22.910 --> 01:28.930
Let's go back to our both of three documentation and decide after that.

01:28.970 --> 01:30.260
All right.

01:30.260 --> 01:35.450
As for our documentation let's just find out the method.

01:35.600 --> 01:40.030
Modify instance attribute.

01:40.340 --> 01:45.070
And let's just see what we're going to have to provide.

01:45.440 --> 01:53.480
And it seems like we're going to have to provide an instance Id just to give the Amazon what is going

01:53.510 --> 01:59.410
to update what's going to modify and then let's see what we can change.

01:59.630 --> 02:08.030
And it seems like we can easily change the API termination specifies that you can't just terminate this

02:08.060 --> 02:11.740
easy to instance once you set this to true.

02:11.900 --> 02:20.540
So if you try to use to shut down this easy to instance with like both a three or a WSC a lie or anything

02:20.540 --> 02:23.000
else you can't just simply do that.

02:23.210 --> 02:30.950
To do that you're going to have to go to a W-S console with appropriate permissions and just do that.

02:30.950 --> 02:33.710
So let's go back and try this.

02:33.770 --> 02:34.450
All right.

02:34.550 --> 02:42.100
So I'm going down here and I'm simply going to say disable API termination.

02:42.260 --> 02:53.540
And since this is expecting a dictionary type I'm going to go down here and I'm going to say value as

02:56.240 --> 03:02.420
so says the method make the argument name is disable API termination.

03:02.520 --> 03:07.600
I'm going to set it to true so that my insoles won't be able to shut down.

03:07.830 --> 03:11.500
So let's just go back to verify our Dictionnaire structure.

03:11.700 --> 03:16.320
And as you can see we're correct with our implementation.

03:16.320 --> 03:22.270
So the other thing that we need to do is we're going to have to provide the instance ID.

03:22.980 --> 03:34.030
So for eastern side the lets us go back to a console for a moment and get our instance Id So what I

03:34.030 --> 03:39.690
want to do now is to get the public easy two instances ID.

03:39.820 --> 03:46.990
So this is my public easy to instance and I'm going to just copy the instance ID or I can just click

03:46.990 --> 03:56.170
on here and I just copy that to clipboard and I'm going to pass in the instance ID from my method.

03:56.230 --> 03:58.960
So instance ID.

03:59.170 --> 04:09.310
And let's just also print out that we're going to modify this easy to instance and modifying easy to

04:09.310 --> 04:14.260
instance an instance ID right.

04:15.420 --> 04:27.610
Let's just close this up and the comma here and we can now go back to our main class in our main class.

04:27.610 --> 04:37.360
After describing these two instances I'm just going to add another method modify instance and I'm going

04:37.360 --> 04:42.920
to say that I will not modify this easy to instance.

04:43.420 --> 04:54.530
And within that method I just first going to place the instance ID and just leave it there for a reference

04:54.730 --> 05:02.010
and then I'm going to copy the easy to access for methods for easy reuse of course.

05:02.050 --> 05:11.740
So I'm just going to go down here and I'm going to say easy to response and then you see to dot modify

05:11.830 --> 05:20.520
is to instance and this method is only expecting the instance ID from me so I can just provide that.

05:20.620 --> 05:29.590
And I'm just cutting this and then I'm just passing it into my method call an all new thing that I have

05:29.590 --> 05:34.120
to do is just print out the result from a WS.

05:34.330 --> 05:42.410
But if we go and check out the documentation it simply doesn't return anything.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.490
And here we go.

05:44.530 --> 05:52.330
It just doesn't return anything but so we can just get rid of this and we can just call this method

05:53.470 --> 06:00.850
without taking any response from a WS since the API is not returning anything.

06:00.850 --> 06:09.130
So I'm just going to comment this line out and on just going to call my new method modify instance.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.230
So now let's just see what's going to happen.

06:13.230 --> 06:16.060
I'm running this method now.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.380
And here we go.

06:18.470 --> 06:24.330
Are is to instance our public easy to instance is now modified.

06:24.610 --> 06:34.040
So with this way I cannot terminate this easy to instance from Bothell 3 or U.S. ally or simply any

06:34.250 --> 06:39.230
command line to any API for us for doing that.

06:39.260 --> 06:46.720
I have to go to Amazon AWOS cancel and terminate the machine by my head.
