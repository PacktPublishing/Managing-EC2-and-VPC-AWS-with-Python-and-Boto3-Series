00:02.410 --> 00:09.190
All right we're back to our project and we're not going to take a look at how to describe instances

00:09.370 --> 00:11.110
on A W-S.

00:11.620 --> 00:17.950
So to do that let me just first close this tab and we can see everything clearly.

00:18.070 --> 00:22.560
So no what we want to do is describe instances with both of three.

00:22.720 --> 00:30.710
And to do that I'm going to go to my easy to class and I'm going to add a method for describing easy

00:30.730 --> 00:40.240
to instances describe easy to instances or right for the arguments.

00:40.250 --> 00:48.770
I'm just going to leave them as it is right now and I'm simply going to return self underscore client

00:49.760 --> 01:02.420
describe an instance is here we go and you can also see that you can specifically describe and specific

01:02.420 --> 01:06.660
properties of these two instances like their status.

01:06.800 --> 01:14.270
If they're reserved or not and they are scheduled or any other thing for is the two instances.

01:14.270 --> 01:22.100
But for now what I'm interested in is describe instances method the best method for describing the two

01:22.100 --> 01:23.040
instances.

01:23.210 --> 01:27.130
So let's hit enter and see what's going to happen.

01:27.440 --> 01:33.320
And except from the dry run parameter we can provide instance IDs.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.090
Let me just bring that up again.

01:35.180 --> 01:43.850
We can provide instance IDs we can have filters for various things like tags and other things like IP

01:43.850 --> 01:46.590
version 4 IP version 6 et cetera.

01:46.880 --> 01:53.900
And then we can have the next token for the next resolve within the instances list when we describe

01:54.000 --> 02:02.340
these two instances and you can also limit the number of results for as being TMX results for your describe

02:02.420 --> 02:03.920
instances method.

02:04.460 --> 02:11.990
And the cool thing about this describe instances method if you do not specify an instance IDs in the

02:12.020 --> 02:20.750
parameters it describes everything on your account on that region for your defined region on your client

02:20.810 --> 02:22.330
on AWOS.

02:22.340 --> 02:28.610
So that's what we're going to do now since none of these arguments are required for this client.

02:28.640 --> 02:32.280
Then I can just simply use to describe instances method.

02:32.480 --> 02:45.460
So let's just add a print statement so that we're describing We see two instances in.

02:45.650 --> 02:49.390
Let's just add some dots there.

02:49.780 --> 02:55.360
Since this is going to take some time to describe and here we go.

02:55.510 --> 02:58.960
The only thing that we need is to call this method.

02:59.140 --> 03:07.180
And again I should note that you can just pass in some easy to instance IDs and just describe those

03:07.180 --> 03:07.640
things.

03:07.650 --> 03:15.160
Or if you have like thousands of easy to instances you can just simply specify the maximum result of

03:15.190 --> 03:16.840
easy two instances.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.800
After you call this method.

03:19.000 --> 03:29.640
So let's go back to our main class and from there I'm just going to type in another method since we

03:29.640 --> 03:36.900
have our main method already around for us and we can't just simply run that without deleting all the

03:36.900 --> 03:39.260
resources on a US.

03:39.300 --> 03:45.730
I'm going to define another method as describe instances.

03:46.140 --> 03:55.650
All right describe instances method is simply going to call my PC to dot describe the two instances

03:55.650 --> 04:03.030
method but for doing that of course I have to get the easy to Colline first just like we did with our

04:03.030 --> 04:04.230
main client.

04:04.230 --> 04:14.520
Main method actually and I'm going to say easy to client and then get client and after that what I'm

04:14.520 --> 04:22.290
going to do is I'm going to get the easy to reference for my actual Easy to a class and a way to do

04:22.290 --> 04:28.040
that is easy to an easy to client just like that.

04:28.050 --> 04:35.370
So we had a reference to our easy to class just as we did with our previous implementation as you can

04:35.370 --> 04:36.850
see here.

04:36.870 --> 04:42.630
So what we're going to do now is simply call the descrive instances method.

04:42.990 --> 04:51.540
All right so once we call this method it's going to describe you see two instances and what I want to

04:51.540 --> 04:57.160
do now is I just want to simply print out everything coming out of this method.

04:57.450 --> 05:06.120
So let's just get a reference for this response and I'm just going to say see two response and print

05:06.120 --> 05:14.160
out the result and I can just simply call this with a string wrapping since this is going to be a list

05:14.220 --> 05:20.970
or a dictionary but I don't care right now because I just want to print out the result and I can say

05:21.030 --> 05:23.220
easy to response.

05:23.220 --> 05:29.340
And the other thing I'm going to do is I'm going to comment out this main method call and I just want

05:29.340 --> 05:32.600
to have the describe instances method call.

05:32.640 --> 05:33.880
All right.

05:34.110 --> 05:40.420
So let's do that now and see if we can get the two instances from a double.

05:40.500 --> 05:47.690
One of them being as the private easy to instance and the other one is the public is to instance.

05:47.730 --> 05:48.980
So let's just hit run

05:51.980 --> 05:53.610
and here we go.

05:53.820 --> 06:00.110
We are easy to instances from their image IDs to their instances.

06:00.110 --> 06:09.860
And what the key player as you can see here we have all of atre about are you see two instances.

06:10.430 --> 06:17.620
And as you can see we have the private IP address public IP address.

06:17.620 --> 06:21.400
And this is our public easy to Easton's as you can guess.

06:21.730 --> 06:28.080
And we have all the data about an easy to instance.

06:28.150 --> 06:34.320
So this is how to check out and describe your two instances on a with us.

06:34.330 --> 06:44.020
Again you can't just simply pass instance IDs on this method as we can see here and you can just specify

06:44.140 --> 06:47.350
the instances to filter on a Dober U.S..
