00:01.750 --> 00:08.970
So one last thing to know before we wrap up with our easy to section is to learn how to terminate easy

00:09.010 --> 00:10.640
to instances.

00:10.930 --> 00:22.810
So to do that let's just create another method to terminate instance and let's just check out the signature

00:22.810 --> 00:30.700
of this method self underscore client terminate instances.

00:30.730 --> 00:38.920
So and as you can see it has a very similar structure with the start and stop instances methods.

00:38.970 --> 00:43.370
So all we have to do is provide instance IDs to this method.

00:43.490 --> 00:47.110
And so I just want to shut down a single instance.

00:47.280 --> 00:53.720
I just want to provide instance Id all right within a list format.

00:53.850 --> 01:03.840
And I also passed this within my method parameters and I'm going to say in a print statement terminating

01:05.130 --> 01:12.400
easy to instance and also the instance Id just like that.

01:12.420 --> 01:21.810
So let's go back to our main implementation and in there again another method for terminate instance

01:23.890 --> 01:26.470
right within this method.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.610
I'm going to do a very similar thing again.

01:30.240 --> 01:38.160
I'm just going to copy this client retrieval calls and I'm just going to use them too easy to dot terminate

01:38.250 --> 01:47.460
instance and within that terminate instance I'm going to pass in the private easy to instance ID and

01:47.700 --> 01:53.190
I'm going to be expecting it to be terminated on A W-S.

01:53.220 --> 01:58.320
So that's everything I need to terminate an instance on A W-S.

01:58.320 --> 02:05.390
So let's just go down here and comment out the start instance call and at our terminate instance call

02:05.700 --> 02:06.900
just like that.

02:07.350 --> 02:15.720
So I'm going to hit Crohn and check out the AWOS console and hit refreshed.

02:16.200 --> 02:25.170
And as you can see our instance is being shut down on a deal with us within a couple of seconds or maybe

02:25.200 --> 02:31.740
couple of minutes depending on the size of the U.S. two instances and the resources they use.

02:31.740 --> 02:40.510
It's going to be set to terminate it with a red mark indicating the termination status.

02:40.510 --> 02:48.370
So this is basically have to terminate the two instances on a deal with us as you can see it's kind

02:48.370 --> 02:53.400
of that simple to do with with Python and both all three.

02:53.430 --> 03:00.330
So in the next videos we're going to wrap up what we learn in this section and what we actually learn

03:00.360 --> 03:02.220
in easy too.

03:02.310 --> 03:06.310
So I'll be seeing you on the next video to wrap things up.
