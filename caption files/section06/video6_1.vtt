00:00.790 --> 00:06.660
All right we're together with another section on Python and both are three.

00:07.060 --> 00:16.390
And in this section with the PC part 2 we're going to be creating first a public cabinet and after that

00:16.690 --> 00:21.930
we're going to allow us to assign public IP addresses on those subnets.

00:22.060 --> 00:27.910
And of course this subnet is going to be a part of the VPC that we created earlier.

00:28.330 --> 00:33.380
And after that we're going to create a PRI with some net.

00:33.590 --> 00:41.000
And when we finish with our private subnet which is isolated from the Internet world or the outside

00:41.000 --> 00:49.280
world we're going to create a route table for our public routes or public subnet so we can access this

00:49.640 --> 00:54.040
net resources from the Internet or over the Internet.

00:54.380 --> 01:02.540
And after we finish with our public route table we're going to add our internet gateway route to route

01:02.660 --> 01:11.150
table for our public subnet so that we can get a way to access their resources under the public subnet

01:12.640 --> 01:19.360
and when we are finished with all that we're going to associate our public subnet with the public route

01:19.360 --> 01:25.940
table so that they can be connected together to form alongside.

01:25.940 --> 01:33.200
So this has basically sums up what we're going to do in this section and let's get to our implementation

01:33.230 --> 01:34.960
and I'll be seeing you on the next video.
