00:01.580 --> 00:09.500
So we're finished with our public subnet creation and their subsequent resources like Internet gateways

00:09.560 --> 00:11.290
and root tables.

00:11.300 --> 00:17.470
So now we're going to have to create a private subnet for that purpose.

00:17.600 --> 00:25.550
Since we have the subnet method as the Create subnet in our BPC class I'm just going to make use of

00:25.550 --> 00:26.430
that.

00:26.450 --> 00:39.710
So let's just comment out here create a private subnet and within there since I'm going to get the response

00:39.740 --> 00:51.050
from our AWOS call private underscore subnet underscore response and I'm going to call create subnet

00:51.090 --> 01:01.490
Methot and I'm going to provide the VPC ID saying the PC that we're going to create and 40 cyder block

01:02.360 --> 01:10.460
this time I'm going to pick 10 out zero dot to zero slash 24.

01:10.970 --> 01:18.620
And as you can see it's different from our first public subnet IP block and this have to be different

01:18.830 --> 01:20.740
from our public subnet.

01:20.750 --> 01:27.950
BLOCK Because that way it's going to cause a collision and AWOS won't be able to create this subnet

01:27.950 --> 01:29.630
for me.

01:29.630 --> 01:37.430
I'm going to have to pick another range of IP addresses or side or block in a couple of US case.

01:37.430 --> 01:42.700
So this is going to allow me to create my private subnet.

01:42.990 --> 01:51.980
And let's also get the private subnet ID so that we can make use of it in later parts just like we did

01:51.980 --> 01:54.480
with our public subnet.

01:54.500 --> 02:05.000
So let's just copy this part of the public subnet I.D. passing arguments and let's just say private

02:05.360 --> 02:14.640
subnet ID is going to be private subnet response and then let's just paste it here we go.

02:14.840 --> 02:23.080
We have our private subnet Id pass into our string object.

02:23.210 --> 02:39.680
So let's us also say that we created our private subnet and create it private subnet and was also passed

02:39.680 --> 02:56.540
the private subnet tidy and let's say for the PC and then the PC Id just like that cell that's basically

02:56.540 --> 03:04.010
all we're going to do for our private subnet says we're not going to allow resources to be accessed

03:04.010 --> 03:05.430
through Internet.

03:05.450 --> 03:13.190
We're not going to attach this subnet to our or associate to submit to our public route table.

03:13.190 --> 03:20.810
We're going to just leave it as is so it is going to be automatically associated with our default route

03:20.810 --> 03:25.190
table when we created these BPC.

03:25.390 --> 03:34.360
So one last thing before we move on with the other section for our resources like is two and other things

03:35.410 --> 03:42.780
we're going to need to provide some name tags to our subnets so that we can be clear about our subnets

03:42.790 --> 03:50.200
when we launch them on AWOS so that we can distinguish them easily when we see them because as you can

03:50.200 --> 03:56.340
see when we create our subnets we're not passing any name arguments or anything like that.

03:56.470 --> 04:04.510
AWOS automatically not allowing to attach or provide a name for our resources like subnets.

04:04.510 --> 04:15.310
So let's just make some calls here and let's just add a tech to our subnet and name tag actually to

04:16.000 --> 04:19.820
private subnet.

04:19.810 --> 04:27.520
And as you can see from the beginnings of our lectures we already have a method implemented when we

04:27.520 --> 04:29.330
launch our BPC.

04:29.410 --> 04:36.910
And as you can see it is the name tech and the good part of that method is it is simply expecting a

04:36.910 --> 04:46.510
resource ID and resource name to attach to that resource as the name argument or name property.

04:46.510 --> 04:51.090
So since this is a generic method we can make use of that.

04:51.100 --> 04:55.630
So let's just go down below and make use of that method here.

04:55.780 --> 05:01.470
And let's just say we see dot at name tag.

05:02.230 --> 05:10.550
And for resource ID I'm going to pass in the private subnet ID and forward the name of that resource.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.270
I'm going to say both all three.

05:13.270 --> 05:20.110
And also you can say simply anything you want both all three private

05:22.670 --> 05:26.020
and subnet just like that.

05:26.690 --> 05:33.970
Let's just keep the convention and let's just also do that for our public subnet.

05:34.490 --> 05:43.460
So I'm going to copy this line right here and I'll just go up to my public subnet creation and after

05:43.460 --> 05:56.270
that add name tag to public something that and in there I'm going to pass in the public subnet tidy

05:56.900 --> 06:00.850
and I'm going to change the private to public.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.600
Here we go.

06:02.660 --> 06:07.990
So we tasked our public and private subnets to proper naming

06:11.110 --> 06:13.980
to summarize what we have done in this section.

06:14.230 --> 06:15.840
I'll be seeing you on the next video.
