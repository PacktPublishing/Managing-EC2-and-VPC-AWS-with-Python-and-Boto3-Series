00:01.560 --> 00:09.660
So now it's time to add a route to our public route table for our internet gateway so anyone can access

00:09.660 --> 00:10.050
it.

00:10.980 --> 00:15.960
So for that purpose we're going to have to add a route to our route table.

00:15.960 --> 00:25.230
So let's go to our P.S. class and within our Ribisi class I'm going to implement another method and

00:25.230 --> 00:38.090
I'm going to say create internet gateway a route to public route table.

00:38.580 --> 00:47.670
So we're declarative naming and after that let's just see what we're going to have to provide to adding

00:47.680 --> 01:00.030
root with the client and decide after that self underscore client and create underscore route and from

01:00.060 --> 01:05.080
there there are simply a lot of things that we have to provide.

01:05.240 --> 01:13.970
But the most important part for adding a route is adding the route table idea of course and then you're

01:13.970 --> 01:20.630
going to have to provide the destination side or block which is going to be used as the access level

01:20.630 --> 01:26.450
control because you're not going to want to allow everyone coming from the Internet.

01:26.480 --> 01:33.470
But for our purposes for our testing purposes we're going to be providing zero IP blocks so anyone can

01:33.470 --> 01:36.980
come up to our public subnet.

01:36.980 --> 01:44.330
And also we're going to have to provide the gateway ID as you can see here.

01:44.450 --> 01:52.710
These are basically all we have to provide to our table or to root for that root table.

01:53.980 --> 02:01.340
So let's just provide the root table first and I'm going to say root tape allowed.

02:01.570 --> 02:06.070
As the RTP ID just to be simple.

02:06.550 --> 02:12.240
And after that I'm going to be providing the gateway ID.

02:12.910 --> 02:15.100
So this is the internet gateway.

02:15.100 --> 02:26.140
In our case and I'm going to say AGW ID and also we're going to have to pro-white the destination side

02:26.140 --> 02:26.960
or block.

02:27.340 --> 02:35.770
So since we're on IP version 4 I'm going to be providing destination cyder block if you're using IP

02:35.770 --> 02:43.350
version 6 then you're going to have to provide the destination IP 6 or Version 6 side or block.

02:43.660 --> 02:53.280
So for the side or block I'm going to simply pro-white 0 0 0 slash 0.

02:53.320 --> 02:58.850
So anyone can come to my public subnet resources.

02:59.090 --> 03:00.080
All right.

03:00.500 --> 03:10.220
As you can see we're going to have to pass in the route table ID and also the Internet Gateway Id just

03:10.220 --> 03:11.530
like that.

03:11.580 --> 03:21.210
So now since we know that we need to route table ID and internet gateway ID Let's go back to our main

03:21.210 --> 03:30.310
class and take the route table Id All right we have our public room table response from a couple of

03:30.310 --> 03:40.990
us but to see how to get to the root table Id let's just go to our Bothell 3 documentation and let's

03:40.990 --> 03:47.020
just search for create root table.

03:47.020 --> 03:48.000
Here we go.

03:49.420 --> 03:56.140
The method is simply returning a dictionary and we have the truth table as the root object.

03:56.140 --> 04:00.570
And after that we have Druitt table ID.

04:00.750 --> 04:10.530
So let's just copy the root table and go back to our method and in there I'm going to assign the root

04:10.530 --> 04:21.230
table ID as RTP underscore ID and I'm going to say public truth table response and from their root table

04:21.900 --> 04:26.140
and then root table D.

04:26.520 --> 04:27.320
Here we go.

04:28.120 --> 04:32.980
We have our route table Id received from our response.

04:33.010 --> 04:37.960
So let's use that and also comment out here.

04:38.200 --> 04:47.990
Adding the internet gateway to public table.

04:48.100 --> 04:53.750
Here we go and let's just call the PC dot.

04:53.930 --> 04:54.670
Create

04:57.350 --> 05:01.340
and let's just check out the name of that method.

05:01.340 --> 05:05.050
Create internet gateway your route to public Croot Tejpal

05:07.780 --> 05:12.570
create Internet Gateway your route to public route table.

05:12.670 --> 05:13.760
Here we go.

05:14.350 --> 05:23.340
So let's just pass in the router table ID and then also pass in the Internet Gateway Id just like that

05:24.650 --> 05:34.550
so our route table is really to access or is to be accessed from the internet with the help of internet

05:34.550 --> 05:40.020
gateway and with the of course help of the route to that internet gateway.
