00:01.640 --> 00:08.580
So we created our public subnet and a public route table for that subnet specifically.

00:08.690 --> 00:16.160
And also we attached our internet gateway with the public Croot table and also associated our subnet

00:16.160 --> 00:17.750
with the route table.

00:18.130 --> 00:26.870
But there's one thing missing in this picture to be accessed from the Internet or the internet resources

00:27.140 --> 00:29.750
available to simply everyone.

00:29.780 --> 00:40.010
So for our resources like easy to to get them public IP for themselves we have to allow auto assigned

00:40.070 --> 00:40.870
IP.

00:40.940 --> 00:44.220
Once we allow a resource under these subnets.

00:44.240 --> 00:53.720
So in this case for the public subnet So to solve that we're going to have to enable the public auto

00:53.720 --> 00:57.980
assign IP addresses for resources under these subnets.

00:58.010 --> 01:00.370
So under these public Sublette.

01:00.890 --> 01:06.050
So to solve that we're going to have to modify the subnet attributes.

01:06.290 --> 01:14.690
So let's go to our C-Class and let's just provide a method.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.650
And I'm going to say allow auto assign

01:22.430 --> 01:30.890
IP addresses for subnet.

01:30.930 --> 01:34.850
This is a bit long method name but it is quite declarative.

01:34.850 --> 01:43.710
So let's just try and type in so we can see what we're going to have to pro-white self underscore client.

01:43.770 --> 01:49.840
And then we're going to have to modify the subnet attributes.

01:49.830 --> 02:01.240
And let's just say modifies subnet attributes and it is basically expecting the subnet ID and the map

02:01.300 --> 02:04.830
public IP addresses is a lounge.

02:04.900 --> 02:10.280
And as you can see use a dictionary type not a generic object or string type.

02:10.450 --> 02:20.320
And if you're on IP version 6 then you can also use the sign IP version 6 addresses on creation.

02:20.320 --> 02:27.630
But since we're on pillars and for again we're going to have to use the public IP on lounge.

02:28.060 --> 02:34.380
So there are basically two things that we're going to have to provide for the subnet tidy.

02:34.450 --> 02:44.920
I'm going to pass in a subnet tidy and then I'm going to provide my public ID on lounge and that property

02:44.920 --> 02:47.360
is going to be expecting a dictionary.

02:47.380 --> 02:51.440
So let's just pro-white the dictionary like there's

02:54.170 --> 03:02.480
And within that dictionary I'm going to have to pass on a key value pair and for the value I'm going

03:02.480 --> 03:06.250
to provide just true.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.570
Here we go.

03:07.910 --> 03:15.350
So let's just also pass in the subnet ID from the method signature.

03:15.350 --> 03:22.930
And let's just go back to our main implementation from our main implementation.

03:22.940 --> 03:39.430
Let's just comment out allow auto assigned public IP addresses for subnet just like that.

03:39.950 --> 03:45.920
Let's just fix that typo and let's just call the method that we just created.

03:46.520 --> 03:54.970
Allow us to assign IP addresses so I'm going to have to pass in the public subnet ID.

03:55.010 --> 03:56.490
And here we go.

03:56.870 --> 04:06.710
So once you lounge these are public subnet we'll be able to pass in some or assign some public IP addresses

04:06.950 --> 04:13.130
for our resources like easy to when we launch some machines in a double us.
