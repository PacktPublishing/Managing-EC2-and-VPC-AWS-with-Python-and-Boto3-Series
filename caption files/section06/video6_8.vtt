Before we move on to our next section let's take a look at what we've done in this section in this section.

00:10.760 --> 00:19.990
We first created a public Cybernet so that we can put our resources put our public resources within

00:20.000 --> 00:29.750
the subnet and then we created a specific group table or a public room table namely for our public routes

00:29.880 --> 00:31.640
for this subnet.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.040
And after that we added the internet gateway that we created earlier to do Schrute table so that we

00:40.040 --> 00:49.760
can have an internet access to the subnet and then we simply associate it our public subnet with this

00:50.000 --> 00:58.370
public route table so that it can use this connection while being accessed from internet or going out

00:58.370 --> 01:00.350
to Internet.

01:00.440 --> 01:11.030
And finally for publicity of our public subnet we allowed people to sign on this public subnet so that

01:11.320 --> 01:19.820
when we launch an issue to resource or any other specific resources within this public subnet they can

01:19.880 --> 01:23.950
assign themselves with a public IP address.

01:24.010 --> 01:29.570
It will be a IP version of four address or IP version 6 address.

01:29.690 --> 01:35.620
This is allowed with the modification of a subnet property.

01:35.780 --> 01:45.200
And finally we created a private subnet but we're going to locate or put our private resources private

01:45.200 --> 01:53.970
machines and anything like that so to move all with our Python and both are three implementation I'll

01:53.970 --> 01:55.790
be seeing you on the next section.
