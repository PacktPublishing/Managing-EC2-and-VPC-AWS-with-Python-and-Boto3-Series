00:01.350 --> 00:08.020
So we how our public Cybernet ready to recreate it with both of three.

00:08.040 --> 00:16.290
So for this public subnet to access internet we're going to have to have the attach internet gateway

00:16.410 --> 00:20.910
to the public subnet and also to a testis internet gateway.

00:20.970 --> 00:27.030
We have to have a root table of course after we create a PC.

00:27.060 --> 00:35.100
Amazon is also creating as a table but we're going to use that table for our pro with subnet.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.100
So we're going to keep it unchanged.

00:38.400 --> 00:46.490
We're going to need another and new table for our public subnet so that we can attach our internet gateway

00:46.770 --> 00:50.970
and we can have it accessed from all over the Internet.

00:51.930 --> 01:01.020
So for doing that we're going to create a public route table so that we can allow public access to our

01:01.380 --> 01:05.440
subnet resources our public subnet resources.

01:05.460 --> 01:13.060
So for that purpose I'm going to go to my PC class and let's just close this one.

01:13.290 --> 01:25.400
And within my RE PC class I'm going to type in a Methot create public Ruut table

01:27.990 --> 01:39.180
and let's see what we're going to have to provide to dismember it self underscore client and then create

01:40.360 --> 01:43.730
root table just like that.

01:43.920 --> 01:53.710
And as you can see from the method arguments after dry run of course only we have to provide the BPC

01:53.710 --> 01:54.890
ID.

01:55.180 --> 01:56.920
So let's just do that.

01:57.160 --> 02:04.400
And for the VPC I-T let's pass in a PCI ID.

02:04.480 --> 02:13.270
Here we go and let's just not forget to return this and also a print statement indicating that we're

02:13.540 --> 02:28.560
creating the public route table creating public route table for creepies see of course and that BPC

02:28.590 --> 02:34.040
is going to be as we PC ID.

02:34.480 --> 02:43.510
So let's go back to our main class and from there let's just call this method and also let's just put

02:43.510 --> 02:58.570
a comment there and create a public Ruut table and let's just call the PCT that create public Crute

02:58.570 --> 03:04.250
table and let's pass in the VPC Id just like that.

03:05.310 --> 03:10.410
And also let's just keep the response from public Crute table

03:14.790 --> 03:20.180
public underscore root under call table underscore response.

03:20.180 --> 03:25.090
This is a bit long but it is quite declarative.

03:25.170 --> 03:32.160
So we have a response from our public Croot table creation.

03:32.180 --> 03:39.950
So now our public table is ready and in the next video we're going to add a route to this public route

03:39.950 --> 03:47.360
table for the internet gateway so that anyone coming out of internet can access our AWOS resources.
