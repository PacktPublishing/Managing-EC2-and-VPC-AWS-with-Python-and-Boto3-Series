00:01.310 --> 00:04.660
All right this was quite a section right.

00:04.790 --> 00:11.540
We have a lot of things in the section and just to summarize all the things that we did within the section

00:12.910 --> 00:14.080
in this section.

00:14.210 --> 00:23.450
We first took a look at what we're going to build on A W-S castle and then we created a key pair for

00:23.450 --> 00:25.240
our public and private.

00:25.400 --> 00:32.930
Two instances and the security group for public and another security group for our private easy to instance

00:33.230 --> 00:40.610
and we do all of a start up script for launching a Web page where we launch our public is to instance

00:40.610 --> 00:48.540
on AWOS and then we launched the our public easy to instance within our public subnet on a number of

00:48.540 --> 00:56.180
us and then we verified that our scripts work as expected that we could connect to our public easy to

00:56.180 --> 01:04.340
instance and by doing that we also verified that our hosted web page the index a DML file that we use

01:04.340 --> 01:12.290
as a user data while we lounge are easy to instance for public to instance is working as expected and

01:12.290 --> 01:17.000
we could see the web page as Hello from both all three with Python.

01:18.100 --> 01:26.060
And then be large enough or easy to instance within the private subnet as being the private is to instance.

01:26.200 --> 01:34.300
And also we prepare the subsequent resources like subnets and security groups for that private easy

01:34.300 --> 01:43.150
to instance and for the final part we also verified that its not so easy to connect to these private

01:43.210 --> 01:49.730
easy to instance since its being closed to outside world close to internet.

01:49.810 --> 01:58.360
It is within our private network where we could only connect from sources within private subnet or public

01:58.360 --> 02:00.650
subnet.

02:00.650 --> 02:01.500
All right.

02:01.590 --> 02:08.760
This was a great section where we could exercise how to lounge easy to instances and how to add security

02:08.760 --> 02:14.120
groups to them and also how to add rules and everything in between.

02:14.130 --> 02:21.420
So in the next section we're going to take a look at how to modify have to start and stop machines on

02:21.510 --> 02:22.950
a W-S.

02:22.980 --> 02:25.010
So I'll be seeing you on the next section.
