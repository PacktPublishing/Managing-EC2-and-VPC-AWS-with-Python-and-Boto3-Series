00:01.500 --> 00:07.220
Now we will come to one of the most important parts of our tutorials.

00:07.420 --> 00:15.610
And remember that when you launch a public easy to instance with a startup script startup script is

00:15.790 --> 00:18.310
right here and I'm going to show you.

00:18.310 --> 00:18.840
Yeah.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.220
This is the startup script that we added as the user data on our public.

00:25.220 --> 00:33.920
Easy to instance and that startup script has to be greeting us when we try to access our easy to instance.

00:34.090 --> 00:41.130
Hello from both L3 using Python and does scripts should be available under indexed.

00:41.320 --> 00:49.900
DML and it should be served also from the HTP the server on my PC to instance.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.440
So to verify that.

00:51.520 --> 01:01.230
Let's go to a AWOS and see if we can access our public easy to instance and let's just hit refresh.

01:01.310 --> 01:09.260
And this is our public easy to instance as we can see with the public IP address and we already checked

01:09.530 --> 01:11.550
in the earlier video.

01:11.570 --> 01:20.580
Let's just copy the IP address and let's open a new tab and let's just hit enter to see if we can access

01:20.580 --> 01:22.490
this easy to instance.

01:23.330 --> 01:25.060
And here we go.

01:25.220 --> 01:35.210
This is the great payoff of our efforts on A W-S using Python and both all three with our extensor architecture

01:35.450 --> 01:42.320
using public subnets private subnets and they are specific route tables and Internet gateways.

01:42.510 --> 01:51.110
We were able to allow our machine from public subnet and lounge machine from public subnet to be able

01:51.110 --> 01:53.870
to be accessed from the Internet.

01:53.960 --> 02:01.580
And as you can see our startup script is working just as we expected and with this way you can define

02:01.610 --> 02:09.290
any kind of startup scripts within your easy two instances to be use so that you can do preparation

02:09.290 --> 02:14.190
work before launching your E.C two instances on a W-S.

02:14.510 --> 02:22.370
So I'm really happy to have you displaying this message on AWOS because this is the actual pay off of

02:22.400 --> 02:24.820
our AWOS implementation.

02:24.830 --> 02:35.030
As you can see here you had a great implementation made up of us from our PC two subnets and other resources

02:35.290 --> 02:42.970
and we can see that our efforts are paid off and we can see our message on our web page from our easy

02:42.970 --> 02:45.520
to instances on a W-S.
