After creating our keepers next time we're going to do is create a security group for our public.

00:08.480 --> 00:15.070
Easy to instance so that people coming out of internet can access are easy to instance.

00:15.220 --> 00:24.830
So to do that let's go back to our easy to class and implement a method for creating a security group.

00:25.030 --> 00:30.430
So I'm going to say create security group.

00:30.430 --> 00:39.190
And as I always do I'm going to leave my mother's signature to later on so that I can check out my actual

00:39.190 --> 00:43.720
method signature from A W-S API with both of three.

00:43.720 --> 00:54.070
So let's just try to return self underscore client and then create a security group and within that

00:54.070 --> 01:01.600
security group method except from the dry run again we have to provide the group name description and

01:01.660 --> 01:04.890
a VPC ID for the security group.

01:04.900 --> 01:12.880
So the there are simply three things that we have to provide to this method group name description and

01:12.880 --> 01:14.310
the VPC ID.

01:14.350 --> 01:27.820
So let's just do that green group name is going to be simply group name and description as description.

01:27.820 --> 01:31.820
And the last thing is we PC ID.

01:31.870 --> 01:33.580
So let's just do that.

01:33.610 --> 01:47.030
And let's also pass these arguments in to our method and for the description he Rico and the VPC ID.

01:47.050 --> 01:48.020
All right.

01:48.400 --> 01:53.410
So let's also print out that we're creating a security group

01:56.580 --> 02:04.880
and with name actually to be much more clear about our intentions.

02:06.360 --> 02:17.840
And also let's just indicate the VPC that are using this security group for VPC and PPC ID.

02:17.850 --> 02:18.880
Here we go.

02:19.260 --> 02:24.930
So only thing left is to use this method from our main class.

02:24.930 --> 02:30.600
So let's go back to our main class and make use of this method.

02:32.330 --> 02:41.050
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to first comment out line for my security group creation

02:43.570 --> 02:46.540
create a security group

02:49.200 --> 02:57.000
and in this line what I'm going to do is I'm going to simply call my create security group method and

02:57.000 --> 03:08.240
as you can see here and for group name I'm simply going to create a variable for my public security

03:08.240 --> 03:14.750
group name and I can just keep it as security group.

03:14.990 --> 03:26.300
So to be simple about my variable and my Both are three public security group as S-G.

03:26.480 --> 03:32.120
So let's just fix that variable naming and make it public security group.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.210
All right.

03:33.740 --> 03:36.400
And also add the name to the end.

03:36.530 --> 03:38.220
And here we go.

03:38.240 --> 03:46.850
So if the past is and to our Methot public security group name and the other thing that we're going

03:46.850 --> 03:48.850
to have to pass is the description.

03:48.890 --> 04:03.230
So let's also have the public security group description and let's just say public security group

04:10.690 --> 04:19.470
for public subnet internet access.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.500
All right.

04:20.620 --> 04:28.720
So the intention here is to create a security group that is going to be allowed to be accessed from

04:28.720 --> 04:29.690
the internet.

04:29.920 --> 04:33.010
Anyone can come if we allow them to.

04:33.020 --> 04:40.660
So right now we're just going to create a security group but about the rules of that security group

04:40.780 --> 04:44.070
we're going to do that in just a minute after that.

04:44.080 --> 04:52.260
So let's just pass in the security group description and the last thing that we have to provide is the

04:52.560 --> 04:56.700
VPC I.D. And here we go.

04:56.700 --> 05:04.950
So this is simply everything that we need to create our security group and we have a just simple typo

05:04.950 --> 05:07.360
there and let's just fix those.

05:07.470 --> 05:09.840
Just a second or more.

05:10.390 --> 05:14.710
And here we go.

05:14.720 --> 05:15.190
All right.
