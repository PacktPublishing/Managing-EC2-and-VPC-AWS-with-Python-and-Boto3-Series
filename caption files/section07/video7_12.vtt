As we saw with the response from our public easy to instance and the web page from there we can access

00:08.870 --> 00:10.920
our public easy to instance.

00:11.030 --> 00:15.040
But how about our private is to instance.

00:15.290 --> 00:22.610
And as you can see our private easy to instance doesn't have any public IP addresses as it is being

00:22.610 --> 00:23.230
private.

00:23.360 --> 00:28.740
That's actually what we wanted to achieve with our private easy to instance.

00:28.880 --> 00:37.150
So it has the 10.0 that to that 200 IP as the private IP address.

00:37.430 --> 00:45.280
So it is not possible to go to this easy to instance in any way from the outside internet.

00:45.410 --> 00:52.840
The only way to connect to this is to instance is either from the another machine within the private

00:52.850 --> 01:01.070
easy to instance private subnet actually or from the public subnet or public easy to instance within

01:01.070 --> 01:06.890
the public subnet since they are on the same PC block same BPC.

01:07.010 --> 01:09.430
Then we can simply access them.

01:09.620 --> 01:18.540
And the way to do that is basically using the key pair for private easy to access and remember'd out

01:18.550 --> 01:24.230
we have the same key pair for both public and private is the two instances.

01:24.230 --> 01:27.970
So if you get the.

01:28.150 --> 01:29.380
Sorry about that.

01:29.380 --> 01:40.210
So if we go back to our all part and if you get the private key for our easy two instances and save

01:40.210 --> 01:48.110
that in a file and try to S-sh into our public easy to instance and once you connect there you can use

01:48.110 --> 01:53.720
the same private key for our private easy to instance to connect to that machine.

01:54.010 --> 02:01.180
That's basically the only way for now to connect to our private E.S. two instances.

02:01.180 --> 02:08.200
And for the time being I'm not going to do that but you're definitely encouraged to do within your local

02:08.200 --> 02:13.960
environment to copy this private key and then use it to connect to first to public.

02:13.960 --> 02:22.250
Easy to instance and then to private is to instance that's the basic way to access our private easy

02:22.270 --> 02:23.160
to instance.

02:23.170 --> 02:28.270
Again it's not open to the world to the outside world for accessing.
