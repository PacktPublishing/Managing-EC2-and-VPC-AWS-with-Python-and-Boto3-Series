WEBVTT

00:01.470 --> 00:07.620
So the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to have to add a rule to our security group

00:07.950 --> 00:16.380
so that we can allow people from Internet to access our instances and resources on AWOS within the public

00:16.380 --> 00:21.260
subnet whenever used as Whenever we used a security group.

00:21.330 --> 00:29.070
So to do that we're going to have to add a method as adding the rule for our security group.

00:29.070 --> 00:29.890
All right.

00:30.870 --> 00:40.530
So let's just go to our easy to class and implement our rule creation method for our security group.

00:40.560 --> 00:47.370
So in this case we're just expecting people to come to us not we're going to them not the other way

00:47.370 --> 00:47.750
around.

00:47.760 --> 00:52.740
So we're simply asking for an inbound flu exception here.

00:52.740 --> 01:00.860
So I'm just naming my method at in-bound rule to security.

01:00.900 --> 01:05.910
And actually I'm going to use this method for my public machine.

01:06.070 --> 01:08.370
But let's just keep it this way right now.

01:08.460 --> 01:15.900
And I'm just going to leave the parameters for later on so I can check out the method to see what I'm

01:15.900 --> 01:17.430
going to have to do.

01:18.090 --> 01:26.280
And self-talk client data and the method that we're looking for as the authorized security group ingress

01:26.550 --> 01:33.450
and egress is the the inbound connection identifier for a number of us so we're going to have to look

01:33.450 --> 01:35.630
for the methods on ingress.

01:35.640 --> 01:40.920
And as you can see there are basically two methods involving ingress.

01:40.950 --> 01:48.240
The first one is the authorized security group ingress and the other one is Revox Security Group ingress.

01:48.360 --> 01:55.400
And as you can expect the revoke method is simply removing the rules from security group for inbound.

01:55.500 --> 02:01.680
And the thing that we're neat here dimethyl that we need here is the authorized security group ingress.

02:01.770 --> 02:06.600
So let's just use that and see what we're going to have to pro-white.

02:06.600 --> 02:11.390
So there are a couple of things that we have to provide here.

02:11.450 --> 02:19.650
We either can provide the group name or group ID and then we can have some extensive options here but

02:19.950 --> 02:23.040
we're not going to have to do everything in this year.

02:23.310 --> 02:31.080
Only thing that we have to provide is simply the group ID if we have it and the IP permissions list

02:32.050 --> 02:39.150
that simply everything we're going to have to provide our security group to have our machines being

02:39.150 --> 02:41.750
connected from the outside world.

02:43.890 --> 02:48.180
So let's just pro-white First the group.

02:49.290 --> 02:52.920
And let's just say security

02:55.740 --> 03:06.010
group I.D. and then we're going to allow some IPs to connect to our instances within the security groups

03:06.020 --> 03:14.750
so for the IP permissions I'm going to create a list of objects list of a dictionary actually.

03:14.760 --> 03:23.350
So let's just create our list first and then I'm going to start by adding the items to my dictionary.

03:23.520 --> 03:30.060
So the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to have to define the protocol that I'm allowing

03:30.390 --> 03:31.970
from the outside world.

03:32.010 --> 03:36.980
So I'm going to use the IP protocol key right here.

03:37.050 --> 03:45.960
And for that I'm going to say TCAP so I can just simply allow HTP and other Kline's to connect to my

03:45.960 --> 03:49.820
machines and 40 per declaration.

03:49.980 --> 03:53.510
I'm going to say from port 80.

03:53.610 --> 04:03.900
So people using data simply like browsers and HTP access can connect to my machines and forward the

04:03.900 --> 04:05.940
port.

04:05.940 --> 04:09.870
I'm simply just allowing unsecure connections to my machine.

04:09.870 --> 04:13.840
You can simply fix that with an HTP certificate.

04:14.070 --> 04:17.410
But in this case I'm just going to keep this simple.

04:17.430 --> 04:21.040
So I'm just loving the poor lady here.

04:21.120 --> 04:29.850
So after the port declaration on just simply going to allow the IP ranges to my machines so I'm going

04:29.850 --> 04:32.940
to say again this is expecting a list.

04:33.090 --> 04:37.960
So I'll say cyder IP.

04:38.640 --> 04:43.670
And again this is a key to cyder IP.

04:43.890 --> 04:45.830
And here we go.

04:46.200 --> 04:51.550
I'm going to say zero data zero zero slash zero.

04:51.630 --> 05:01.830
So anyone can come to my PC two instances if I use this subnet if I actually use the security group.

05:01.860 --> 05:02.740
All right.

05:02.880 --> 05:09.000
So this is the first rule to my PC to instance to my security group.

05:09.000 --> 05:16.350
The other thing that I want to do is I want to allow simply like FTB clients to connect to my easy to

05:16.350 --> 05:20.640
instance maybe I can even SS h into my machine.

05:20.670 --> 05:22.160
Maybe you want to do that.

05:22.200 --> 05:33.510
So to allow that capability I'm going to say as the IP protocol again TCAP and for deport of course

05:34.110 --> 05:38.260
the port of the SS H is 22.

05:38.550 --> 05:50.790
So let's just say that and for the port I'm going to say 22 again and then I'm going to allow the IP

05:50.790 --> 05:51.700
ranges.

05:51.770 --> 06:06.830
Again as with the of course side or definition's side or IP and I'm going to allow everyone just for

06:06.830 --> 06:12.130
this time then I'm going to close this because this is kind of dangerous to allow everyone to connect

06:12.130 --> 06:14.760
to your easy to instances.

06:15.680 --> 06:16.750
All right.

06:16.850 --> 06:21.770
We're almost ready with our inbound route for security group creation.

06:22.010 --> 06:27.350
So the only thing that we want to pass in is the security group ID.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.280
So let's just pass into.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.750
And here we go.

06:32.840 --> 06:36.860
We're ready with our inbound security group creation.

06:36.860 --> 06:51.860
And let's also indicate that we're adding the inbound public access to security group and that's also

06:51.890 --> 06:55.060
indicate the idea of this security group.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.940
And here we go.

06:57.980 --> 07:06.620
So now let's just go back to our deployment class and let's just say that we want to have this rule

07:06.620 --> 07:10.420
added to our public security group.

07:10.700 --> 07:20.600
So let's just say at public access to security group.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.640
All right.

07:22.640 --> 07:30.050
The one thing that we're going to have to do is we're going to have to just call this matter first at

07:31.370 --> 07:33.520
of course.

07:33.740 --> 07:40.310
Let's just check out the name of our method for a second and it is add inbound rule

07:43.030 --> 07:46.150
and inbound rule to security group.

07:46.160 --> 07:52.450
So we're expecting to have a security group I.D. just to get that.

07:52.730 --> 07:59.210
I'm going to have to take the response from this method for the security group creation.

07:59.390 --> 08:12.380
So I'm going to say public security group and response here we go.

08:12.460 --> 08:18.130
So how to get the security group Heidi for doing that.

08:18.130 --> 08:24.610
I can see you're saying that we have to check both documentation and you're absolutely right.

08:24.610 --> 08:34.230
So let's go back to our bowlful three documentation and find a method for create security group.

08:34.270 --> 08:35.510
And here we go.

08:36.530 --> 08:42.290
So this method is simply returning a security crew resource.

08:42.300 --> 08:45.430
But this is for implementing resources.

08:45.560 --> 08:50.790
We just want the client method for both of three not to resource one.

08:50.900 --> 08:56.780
So let's just find that out and he Rigaud.

08:57.110 --> 09:06.230
So this method is again returning a type of dictionary and it is simply returning the group ID to us.

09:06.290 --> 09:08.210
All right.

09:08.210 --> 09:10.850
And so forget that group ID.

09:11.060 --> 09:19.720
Let's just go back to our implementation and from the public security group response fetch fetched e-group

09:19.720 --> 09:20.870
ID.

09:21.380 --> 09:23.270
And here we go.

09:23.300 --> 09:32.960
So the public security group Heidi is going to be this one just like that.

09:32.990 --> 09:39.800
So if we passed this in to our methhead Dan for us to go right

09:42.480 --> 09:49.800
so forty one last thing we might just add a print statement for indicating that we added the rule to

09:49.860 --> 09:52.580
our security group.

09:55.130 --> 09:59.180
Added public access through to

10:01.780 --> 10:13.980
security group and the security group of course is public security group name.

10:14.060 --> 10:17.000
And that's actually all we need.

10:17.000 --> 10:24.260
All right let's just leave some blank lines right here so that we can be clear about what we're doing.

10:24.560 --> 10:32.180
And this is basically it for our security group creation and adding an inbound role for our security

10:32.180 --> 10:33.080
group.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.120
So I'll be seeing you on the next media.
