00:02.110 --> 00:06.740
All right after launching our public you see two instance.

00:06.840 --> 00:14.130
The next thing that we're going to do is to lounge a private is to instance so to do that.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.230
There are a couple of things that we're going to have to do.

00:17.460 --> 00:27.680
And the first of those is to have a private security group and to do that I'm going to have to go back

00:27.680 --> 00:38.690
to my UC tube and actually to my yes a C to class and for my security group as you can see I have to

00:38.690 --> 00:46.730
provide a group name a description and a VPC Id only the distinguishing part for the security groups

00:46.760 --> 00:49.580
as being public or private.

00:49.580 --> 00:52.640
Do you have rules that you add to this security group.

00:52.790 --> 01:00.080
But remember Dad says we're adding to security group since we're adding this to instance within the

01:00.080 --> 01:01.700
private subnet.

01:01.760 --> 01:06.850
It's not going to be able to assign itself a public IP address.

01:06.890 --> 01:15.980
So the security group is only matters to the resources within my public and private subnet nothing other

01:15.980 --> 01:16.890
than that.

01:17.150 --> 01:25.580
So let's just duplicate this ad in-bound rule to security group so we can simply allow the same thing

01:25.880 --> 01:31.650
to our private subnet because it's not going to matter for our private easy to instance.

01:31.670 --> 01:38.210
Again this is the way to add the access control to your E.S. to instance.

01:38.210 --> 01:45.530
But again this doesn't make any change to my private easy to instance since it's in the private subnet

01:45.950 --> 01:54.040
without any IP addresses are connections from the outside world except my public subnet.

01:54.080 --> 02:01.580
So let's go back to our implementation class and let's just say

02:04.430 --> 02:08.980
adding a nother security group

02:13.890 --> 02:24.720
for private to instance and for creating the security group.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.330
Let's just say private

02:29.720 --> 02:33.160
security group name.

02:33.890 --> 02:45.530
And I'm going to say both are three private security group and for the description of this security

02:45.530 --> 02:45.860
group

02:49.700 --> 03:06.480
I'm going to say private security group for private subnet and for the last part I'm going to launch

03:06.480 --> 03:08.830
my security group.

03:08.910 --> 03:24.560
So let's just say private security group response is B.S. to dot create security group and forward a

03:24.570 --> 03:32.700
name private security group name and forwarded description.

03:33.330 --> 03:36.990
Private security group description.

03:36.990 --> 03:41.890
That's basically everything I need to have my private security group.

03:42.030 --> 03:49.320
But just like we did with our public security group we're going to have to get the group ID from our

03:49.620 --> 03:51.930
AWOS response.

03:51.930 --> 04:05.790
So let's do that now and private security group I.D. is going to be private security group response

04:05.850 --> 04:08.970
and group Id just like that.

04:09.270 --> 04:17.280
So this information is going to help us to use this private security group when we launch our private

04:17.280 --> 04:22.440
subnet private actually easy to instance within our private subnet.

04:22.440 --> 04:27.300
So let's go down here and now start launching our private.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.720
Easy to instance.

04:28.860 --> 04:37.380
But before we do that let's just take up this a.m.-I to a variable and let's just go up here and say

04:41.520 --> 04:51.230
am I.D. and I'm just going to put that here and also my I'd just like that so we can now lounge are

04:51.440 --> 05:00.910
private is the to instance easy to dot lounge easy to instance and my ID.

05:01.430 --> 05:10.460
I'm going to use the same key pair and I'm going to have a one instance as the minimum and maximum and

05:10.460 --> 05:20.000
private security group ID and for the subnet I'm going to use the private subnet and I don't have to

05:20.000 --> 05:28.580
provide any user data because I simply don't want to have anything launching when I have my easy to

05:28.580 --> 05:30.740
instance lounge on a W-S.

05:30.740 --> 05:33.810
So I'm just going to keep it like this.

05:33.830 --> 05:35.930
All right.

05:36.110 --> 05:42.590
So before we move on let us also add the rule to our security group.

05:42.590 --> 05:43.430
All right.

05:43.700 --> 05:51.710
And to do that we're going to have to call the inbound method that we implemented earlier.

05:51.770 --> 05:54.890
So I'm just going to go down here and

05:57.910 --> 06:04.890
add rule to private security group.

06:05.810 --> 06:12.140
And again this rule set is not going to have any effect in my easy to instance.

06:12.380 --> 06:20.060
This is only for the resources coming from private subnet or the public subnet within my PC.

06:20.150 --> 06:26.040
No one's outside is going to be accessing my see two instance in any way.

06:26.480 --> 06:37.460
So let's just say that and add the rule to our security group for our private security group and here

06:37.460 --> 06:38.370
we go.

06:38.900 --> 06:54.810
Let's just also comment as and say launch and launch a private easy to instance unless also unafraid

06:54.840 --> 06:55.950
does as

07:00.790 --> 07:08.170
lounge a public see to instance.

07:08.170 --> 07:17.890
And here we go while we're actually about to finish our implementation for the most parts of it and

07:18.070 --> 07:25.720
we can now actually Rhonda's and check out how all of this created for us on a W-S.
