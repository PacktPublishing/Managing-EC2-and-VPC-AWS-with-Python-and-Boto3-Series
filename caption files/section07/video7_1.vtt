00:01.540 --> 00:08.590
Are right we're about to start with easy too and working well easier to resources.

00:08.600 --> 00:15.050
So before we dig into private and public see two instances let's take a look at what we're going to

00:15.050 --> 00:18.360
cover in the section in this section.

00:18.500 --> 00:25.520
We're going to take a look at what we're going to build on AWOS castle just like we do with other sections

00:25.520 --> 00:27.840
like subnets and the PCs.

00:27.920 --> 00:35.810
So to get a feeling of what we're going to build on A W-S actually and after that we're going to start

00:36.020 --> 00:45.110
creating some resources on Ws and we'll first start with a key pair to connect to our easy to instance

00:45.200 --> 00:52.540
so that we can use it to connect to the instances that we're going to lunch both for private and public.

00:52.550 --> 00:54.740
Easy to instances.

00:54.740 --> 01:00.080
And after that we're going to create security groups both for private and public.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.760
Easily two instances that we're going to launch.

01:03.050 --> 01:10.140
And after that for our public easy to instance we're going to develop a startup script.

01:10.280 --> 01:17.090
So when we launch our public easy to insiders that script is going to be executed and is going to prepare

01:17.090 --> 01:24.290
a Web site for us to see that if we can possibly connect to our public easily to instance from anywhere

01:24.290 --> 01:25.200
in the world.

01:26.370 --> 01:33.210
And after we finish with our creations and preparations for our easy to instance we're going to actually

01:33.210 --> 01:39.100
change our public easy to instance within our public subnet that we created earlier.

01:39.330 --> 01:46.440
And after that we're going to verify that the script that we developed is working as expected by trying

01:46.440 --> 01:47.990
to connect to our public.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.380
Easy to instance and trying to see the web page that we developed earlier and after we've finished with

01:55.380 --> 02:00.560
our public easy to instance we're going to launch a private is to instance.

02:00.600 --> 02:08.400
So the first private comes from that it's being under the private subnet as a sole resource of our private

02:08.400 --> 02:10.180
subnet.

02:10.310 --> 02:16.040
And after we've finished with launching our private easy to instance we're going to verify that the

02:16.040 --> 02:18.470
connection is not possible to this private.

02:18.470 --> 02:22.900
Easy to instance except from within the subnets itself.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.150
So this is going to be a lot of fun.

02:26.270 --> 02:30.230
A great section to learn about easy to do and how they work.

02:30.230 --> 02:33.890
So are we expecting to see you in the next video.
