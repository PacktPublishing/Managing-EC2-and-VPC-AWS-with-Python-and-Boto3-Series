00:01.480 --> 00:09.940
The one thing that we need to do before I start implementing our applications with AWOS resources we

00:09.940 --> 00:15.850
have to install the both of three library for Python for doing that.

00:15.940 --> 00:20.690
We're going to use the Python package manager our Peppe.

00:21.010 --> 00:34.320
Let's just type in Pipp install and both three and both of three dependencies are being collected right

00:34.320 --> 00:39.390
now by the Python package manager or pip.

00:39.590 --> 00:50.180
And we have the both the core S3 France we're documentation you hotels and some various Python packages

00:50.630 --> 00:59.900
dependent to both a three library so our package manager now is initializing the dependent packages

00:59.900 --> 01:07.180
for Python for both three and they are already now simple as that.

01:07.470 --> 01:13.730
We know how are both all three and every other thing on our machine to work with.

01:13.770 --> 01:15.330
AWOS resources.
