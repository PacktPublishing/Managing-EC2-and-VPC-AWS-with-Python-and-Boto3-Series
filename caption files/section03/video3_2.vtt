00:02.380 --> 00:10.760
Now let's go and download the AWOS apply and have it up and running on our windows machine to do that.

00:10.780 --> 00:18.350
I'll say a WSC apply for Windows just like that.

00:18.430 --> 00:28.840
And from there I'm going to go to the first link from Amazon and on the top right of the screen on there

00:28.840 --> 00:38.290
the window section I can see that 64 bit and 32 bit Windows installers for AWOS command line interface.

00:38.380 --> 00:49.810
And of course since I'm on a 64 bit of operating system Windows 10 I have to select the 64 bit and are

00:50.410 --> 00:51.310
AWOS.

00:51.370 --> 00:52.940
Download is tarting.

00:53.170 --> 01:00.790
And once we finish we're going to start installing us on our windows machine.

01:01.990 --> 01:05.940
All right our AWOS realize Towler is now.

01:05.940 --> 01:06.950
Download it.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.350
Let's just head from

01:10.940 --> 01:18.550
and let's just select the Windows Installer and hit OK.

01:18.620 --> 01:27.050
Now let's hit next and accept the license agreement and we want everything about a WSC a lie on our

01:27.050 --> 01:28.050
computer.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.200
I'll hit next.

01:29.240 --> 01:37.910
And I'm simply going to hit install and of course I am excepting the control of administrator access

01:37.970 --> 01:39.830
for this installer and I'll hit.

01:39.830 --> 01:41.090
Yes.

01:41.090 --> 01:45.470
Now are a WSC allies being installed on our computer.

01:50.390 --> 01:51.530
Here we go.

01:51.530 --> 01:56.370
Our AWOS command line interface is now set up on our windows machine.

01:57.470 --> 02:04.700
Now we have to verify that if we have our a key U.S. ally properly installed on our machine.

02:06.590 --> 02:09.630
To do that let's open up a command prompt

02:16.430 --> 02:21.770
and from there let's just type A W-S.

02:21.820 --> 02:22.540
All right.

02:22.600 --> 02:28.900
As you can see our AWOS command is not recognized with the windows command line.

02:29.200 --> 02:34.050
So there are a few things to do when we receive this error.

02:34.480 --> 02:40.840
The problem is that the AWOS install could not properly set our path for A W-S.

02:40.840 --> 02:46.230
So our command prompt cannot see the command to fix that.

02:46.540 --> 02:58.990
Let's first locate the AWOS CLIA installation and within our computer let's go to our C-Drive and from

02:58.990 --> 03:05.930
there let's go to Program Files and with an Amazon and a U.S..

03:05.980 --> 03:06.630
All right.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.410
This is the base path that we need to get to.

03:09.550 --> 03:16.410
And I'm just going to copy this path and I'm going to search for the environment variables

03:20.040 --> 03:32.520
and from the environment variables I'm going to select the path and I'm going to add the path for our

03:33.060 --> 03:43.670
AWOS Seelye I'll hit OK and I'll just go down below and with the system variables I'm going to do the

03:43.670 --> 03:52.360
exact same thing so that any other user might want to use a a U.S. ally can just simply use it.

03:52.430 --> 03:55.020
So all right.

03:55.060 --> 03:58.550
OK I'll hit ok again.

03:58.830 --> 04:00.700
And here we go.

04:01.140 --> 04:12.250
If we relaunch our command prompt again we should now see the AWOS running.

04:12.350 --> 04:13.790
And here we go.

04:14.060 --> 04:18.860
Our AWOS July is working properly and as we expect.
