00:01.380 --> 00:08.950
The first thing we need to do to set up our environment as of course install Python 3.

00:09.030 --> 00:17.760
So let's do that now and open up a browser window and within the browser window I'm going to simply

00:17.760 --> 00:20.460
go to Python dot org

00:24.000 --> 00:27.660
and with them the python official site

00:33.470 --> 00:42.050
I'm going to go to the download section and I can simply see that downloads for Python for Windows as

00:42.200 --> 00:50.060
the supplied to me right next to the page and I'm interested in the words and tree not the two words.

00:50.240 --> 01:03.220
So I'm going to click on the three dot sixty five and the download has start it.

01:03.310 --> 01:05.650
And here we go.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.640
And downloading is complete.

01:08.660 --> 01:16.410
So let's just run our install right now and let's just customize the installation.

01:16.520 --> 01:26.480
I want the first documentation Pip and I simply just keeping everything about Python just to get every

01:26.480 --> 01:36.200
benefit for Python and I'm just going to go back and I'm going to add Python to path for 3.6.

01:36.200 --> 01:43.010
This is really important because otherwise you won't have to be accessing the python from anywhere in

01:43.010 --> 01:44.550
your file system.

01:44.630 --> 01:49.400
You can simply type python within your command line and you can just start using it.

01:49.520 --> 01:53.990
Otherwise you have to manually do that after the installation.

01:54.450 --> 02:06.210
So I'm going to hit on install now and alt select Yes and Python is being installed on my computer for

02:06.210 --> 02:07.100
Windows.

02:08.320 --> 02:13.520
It's almost complete and here we go.

02:14.780 --> 02:18.860
Our Python installation is ready for Windows.

02:19.250 --> 02:21.010
Let's just go and test it out.

02:21.050 --> 02:30.540
If we have it and to do that I'm going to open up a command prompt I'll type CMD.

02:31.070 --> 02:35.170
And from there I'm simply going to type in Python.

02:35.570 --> 02:43.970
And as you can see I can see the python three dots sixty five on my Windows machine and I have the little

02:43.970 --> 02:46.120
mice interpreter for Python.

02:46.220 --> 02:48.630
I can start playing around with.

02:48.650 --> 02:53.050
So are python installation as ready for Windows.

02:53.270 --> 02:57.350
And we of course have the pip package manager ready.
